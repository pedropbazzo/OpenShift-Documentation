CRI-O is an open source, community-driven container engine.
Its primary goal is to replace the Docker service as the
container engine for Kubernetes implementations, such as {product-title}.

If you want to start using CRI-O, this guide describes how to install
CRI-O during {product-title} installation as well as how to add
a CRI-O node to an existing
{product-title} cluster. The guide also provides
information on how to configure and troubleshoot your CRI-O engine.

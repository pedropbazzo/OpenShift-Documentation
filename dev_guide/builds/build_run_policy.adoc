[[build-run-policy]]
== Build Run Policy Overview

The build run policy describes the order in which the builds created from the
build configuration should run. This can be done by changing the value of the
`runPolicy` field in the `spec` section of the `Build` specification.

It is also possible to change the `runPolicy` value for existing build
configurations.

  * Changing `Parallel` to `Serial` or `SerialLatestOnly` and triggering a
    new build from this configuration will cause the new build to wait until all
    parallel builds complete as the serial build can only run alone.
  * Changing `Serial` to `SerialLatestOnly` and triggering a new build will
    cause cancellation of all existing builds in queue, except the currently
    running build and the most recently created build. The newest build will
    execute next.

[[build-serial-run-policy]]
== Serial Run Policy

Setting the `runPolicy` field to `Serial` will cause all new builds created
from the `Build` configuration to be run sequentially. That means there
will be only one build running at a time and every new build will wait until
the previous build completes. Using this policy will result in consistent and
predictable build output. This is the default `runPolicy`.

Triggering three builds from the *sample-build* configuration, using the
`Serial` policy will result in:

----
NAME             TYPE      FROM          STATUS    STARTED          DURATION
sample-build-1   Source    Git@e79d887   Running   13 seconds ago   13s
sample-build-2   Source    Git           New
sample-build-3   Source    Git           New
----

When the *sample-build-1* build completes, the *sample-build-2* build will run:

----
NAME             TYPE      FROM          STATUS    STARTED          DURATION
sample-build-1   Source    Git@e79d887   Completed 43 seconds ago   34s
sample-build-2   Source    Git@1aa381b   Running   2 seconds ago    2s
sample-build-3   Source    Git           New

[[build-serial-latest-only-run-policy]]
== SerialLatestOnly Run Policy

Setting the `runPolicy` field to `SerialLatestOnly` will cause all new builds
created from the `Build` configuration to be run sequentially, same as using
the `Serial` run policy. The difference is that when a currently running build
completes, the next build that will run is the latest build created. In other
words, you do not wait for the queued builds to run, as they are skipped.
Skipped builds are marked as *Cancelled*. This policy can be used for fast,
iterative development.

Triggering three builds from the *sample-build* configuration, using the
`SerialLatestOnly` policy will result in:

----
NAME             TYPE      FROM          STATUS    STARTED          DURATION
sample-build-1   Source    Git@e79d887   Running   13 seconds ago   13s
sample-build-2   Source    Git           Cancelled
sample-build-3   Source    Git           New
----

The *sample-build-2* build will be canceled (skipped) and the next build
run after *sample-build-1* completes will be the *sample-build-3* build:

----
NAME             TYPE      FROM          STATUS    STARTED          DURATION
sample-build-1   Source    Git@e79d887   Completed 43 seconds ago   34s
sample-build-2   Source    Git           Cancelled
sample-build-3   Source    Git@1aa381b   Running   2 seconds ago    2s
----

[[build-parallel-run-policy]]
== Parallel Run Policy

Setting the `runPolicy` field to `Parallel` causes all new builds created from
the `Build` configuration to be run in parallel. This can produce
unpredictable results, as the first created build can complete last, which will
replace the pushed container image produced by the last build which completed
earlier.

Use the parallel run policy in cases where you do not care about the order in
which the builds will complete.

Triggering three builds from the *sample-build* configuration, using the
`Parallel` policy will result in three simultaneous builds:

----
NAME             TYPE      FROM          STATUS    STARTED          DURATION
sample-build-1   Source    Git@e79d887   Running   13 seconds ago   13s
sample-build-2   Source    Git@a76d881   Running   15 seconds ago   3s
sample-build-3   Source    Git@689d111   Running   17 seconds ago   3s
----

The completion order is not guaranteed:

----
NAME             TYPE      FROM          STATUS    STARTED          DURATION
sample-build-1   Source    Git@e79d887   Running   13 seconds ago   13s
sample-build-2   Source    Git@a76d881   Running   15 seconds ago   3s
sample-build-3   Source    Git@689d111   Completed 17 seconds ago   5s
----

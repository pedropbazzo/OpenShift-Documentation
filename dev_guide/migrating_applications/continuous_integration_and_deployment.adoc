== Overview

This topic reviews the differences in continuous integration and deployment
(CI/CD) applications between OpenShift version 2 (v2) and OpenShift version 3
(v3) and how to migrate these applications into the v3 environment.

== Jenkins

The Jenkins applications in OpenShift version 2 (v2) and OpenShift version 3
(v3) are configured differently due to fundamental differences in architecture.
For example, in v2, the application uses an integrated Git repository that is
hosted in the gear to store the source code. In v3, the source code is located
in a public or private Git repository that is hosted outside of the pod.

Furthermore, in OpenShift v3, Jenkins jobs can not only be triggered by source
code changes, but also by changes in ImageStream, which are changes on the
images that are used to build the application along with its source code. As a
result, it is highly recommended that you migrate the Jenkins application
manually by creating a new Jenkins application in v3, and then re-creating jobs
with the configurations that are suitable to OpenShift v3 environment.

application, configure jobs, and use Jenkins plug-ins properly:

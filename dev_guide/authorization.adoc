== Checking If Users Can Create Pods

Using the `scc-review` and `scc-subject-review` options, you can see if an
individual user, or a user under a specific service account, can create or
update a pod.

Using the `scc-review` option, you can check if a service account can create or
update a pod. The command outputs the security context constraints that admit
the resource.

For example, to check if a user with the
`system:serviceaccount:projectname:default` service account can a create a pod:

----
$ oc policy scc-review -z system:serviceaccount:projectname:default -f my_resource.yaml
----

You can also use the `scc-subject-review` option to check whether a specific
user can create or update a pod:

----
$ oc policy scc-subject-review -u <username> -f my_resource.yaml
----

To check if a user belonging to a specific group can create a pod in a specific
file:

----
$ oc policy scc-subject-review -u <username> -g <groupname> -f my_resource.yaml
----

== Determining What You Can Do as an Authenticated User

From within your {product-title} project, you can determine what
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#evaluating-authorization[verbs]
you can perform against all namespace-scoped resources (including third-party
resources).

The `can-i` command  option tests scopes in terms of the user and role.

----
$ oc policy can-i --list --loglevel=8
----

The output helps you to determine what API request to make to gather the
information.

To receive information back in a user-readable format, run:

----
$ oc policy can-i --list
----

The output provides a full list.

To determine if you can perform specific verbs, run:

----
$ oc policy can-i <verb> <resource>
----

== Overview
For each of your projects, you can choose to receive email notifications about
various failures, including:

* _Dead deployment_: A failed deployment in which no other deployment in the
rollout history is able to remain active. The related deployment configuration
has no deployments with active replicas.

* _Failed deployment_: A new deployment fails and another deployment in the
rollout history is now active. The related deployment configuration has one
active deployment, but it is not the latest deployment.

* _Stuck deployment_: A deployment in which the active replicas are less than the
replicas defined by the deployment configuration for a significant amount of
time.

* _Dead build_: Occurs when automatically triggered builds are failing for a
specified build configuration that previously had successful builds.

* _Dead persistent volume claim_: A claim that is in the pending state for longer
than some reasonable amount of time. These are claims whose resource requests
likely do not match with any existing persistent volumes in the cluster.

* _Lost persistent volume claim_: A claim that is bound to a backing persistent
volume, but the persistent volume has unexpectedly gone away.

[[notifications-how-it-works]]
== How It Works

The Notifications feature continually monitors resources across the
cluster. When problems are detected, notifications are sent to the email address
of the project creator, designated in the `requester` field of the project.
These notifications are throttled so that the recipient is not overwhelmed with
email messages.

[[notifications-storing-preferences]]
== Storing Preferences

The Notifications feature uses a
xref:../dev_guide/configmaps.adoc#dev-guide-configmaps[ConfigMap] named
`openshift-online-notifications` in each namespace to store preferences. The
preferences allow users to specify which resources they would like to receive
notifications for. An interface is provided in the web console to easily
xref:notifications-configuring-notifications[modify these preferences].

.Example ConfigMap for Notification Preferences
----
[source,yaml]
---
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: openshift-online-notifications
  namespace: example
data:
  builds-enabled: 'true'
  deployments-enabled: 'true'
  storage-enabled: 'true'
----

If the ConfigMap is not present, it is assumed that notifications are disabled.
The email address used is the email address of the project owner.

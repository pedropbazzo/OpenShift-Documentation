== Overview

{product-title} is designed for building and deploying applications. Depending
on how much you want to involve {product-title} in your development process, you
can choose to:

- focus your development within an {product-title} project, using it to build an
application from scratch then continuously develop and manage its lifecycle, or
- bring an application (e.g., binary, container image, source code) you have
already developed in a separate environment and deploy it onto {product-title}.

== Using {product-title} as Your Development Environment

You can begin your application's development from scratch using {product-title}
directly. Consider the following steps when planning this type of development
process:

*Initial Planning*

* What does your application do?
* What programming language will it be developed in?

*Access to {product-title}*

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
* {product-title} should be installed by this point, either by yourself or an
administrator within your organization.
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated[]
* You should have access to an {product-title} instance. If you are not sure of
these details, contact your {product-title} cluster administrator.
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-online[]
* Access {product-title} by logging in and creating an account at
link:https://openshift.com/get-started/[].
endif::[]

*Develop*

* Using your editor or IDE of choice, create a basic skeleton of an application. It
should be developed enough to tell {product-title}
xref:new_app.adoc#language-detection[what kind of application it
is].
* Push the code to your Git repository.

*Generate*

* xref:new_app.adoc#dev-guide-new-app[Create a basic application] using the `oc new-app`
command. {product-title} generates build and deployment configurations.

*Manage*

* Start developing your application code.
* Ensure your application builds successfully.
* Continue to locally develop and polish your code.
* Push your code to a Git repository.
* Is any extra configuration needed? Explore the
xref:../../dev_guide/index.adoc#dev-guide-index[Developer Guide] for more options.

*Verify*

* You can verify your application in a number of ways. You can push your changes
to your application's Git repository, and use {product-title} to rebuild and redeploy
your application. Alternatively, you can hot deploy using `rsync` to synchronize
your code changes into a running pod.

== Bringing an Application to Deploy on {product-title}

image::developing_then_deploying.png["Developing then deploying on {product-title}"]

Another possible application development strategy is to develop locally, then use
{product-title} to deploy your fully developed application. Use the
following process if you plan to have application code already, then want to
build and deploy onto an {product-title} installation when completed:

*Initial Planning*

* What does your application do?
* What programming language will it be developed in?

*Develop*

* Develop your application code using your editor or IDE of choice.
* Build and test your application code locally.
* Push your code to a Git repository.

*Access to {product-title}*

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
* {product-title} should be installed by this point, either by yourself or an
administrator within your organization.
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated[]
* You should have access to an {product-title} instance. If you are not sure of
these details, contact your {product-title} cluster administrator.
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-online[]
* Access {product-title} by logging in and creating an account at
link:https://www.openshift.com/get-started/[].
endif::[]

*Generate*

* xref:new_app.adoc#dev-guide-new-app[Create a basic application] using the `oc new-app`
command. {product-title} generates build and deployment configurations.

*Verify*

* Ensure that the application that you have built and deployed in the above
Generate step is successfully running on {product-title}.

*Manage*

* Continue to develop your application code until you are happy with the results.
* Rebuild your application in {product-title} to accept any newly pushed code.
* Is any extra configuration needed? Explore the
xref:../../dev_guide/index.adoc#dev-guide-index[Developer Guide] for more options.

== Overview

The `StorageClass` resource object describes and classifies storage that can be
requested, as well as provides a means for passing parameters for dynamically
provisioned storage on demand. `StorageClass` objects can also serve as a
management mechanism for controlling different levels of storage and access to
the storage. Cluster administrators (users with `cluster-admin` privileges) or
storage administrators (users with `storage-admin` privileges) define and create
the `StorageClass` objects that users can request without needing any intimate
knowledge about the underlying storage volume sources.

In {product-title}, the storage class is configured and a single option is
available to the user based on the underlying cloud provider.

it through the following paths:

* *Cluster ID*: The unique cluster name provided by the customer during provisioning. It is lowercase, and only contains letters, numbers, and hyphens.

* *Console URL*: The {product-title} URL for the
xref:../architecture/infrastructure_components/web_console.adoc#architecture-infrastructure-components-web-console[web

[[configuring-your-application-routes]]
== Configure your application routes

When your cluster is provisioned, an AWS elastic load balancer (ELB) is created
to route application traffic into the cluster. The domain for your ELB is
configured to route application traffic via
`http(s)://*.<shard-id>.<cluster-id>.openshiftapps.com`. The `<shard-id>` is a
four-character string that is communicated to you after initial provisioning.

If you want to use custom domain names for your application routes, you should
set up a CNAME record in your DNS host to point to
*_elb.<shard-id>.<cluster-id>.openshiftapps.com_*. While `elb` is recommended as a
reminder for where this record is pointing, you can use any string for this
value. You can create these CNAME records for each custom route you have, or you
can create a wildcard CNAME record. For example:

----
*.openshift.example.com    CNAME    elb.1234.my-example.openshiftapps.com
----

This allows you to create routes like *_app1.openshift.example.com_* and
*_app2.openshift.example.com_* without having to update your DNS every time.

Customers with configured VPC peering or VPN connections have the option of
requesting a second ELB, so that application routes can be configured as
internal-only or externally available. The domain for this ELB will be identical
to the first, with a different `<shard-id>` value. By default, application
routes are handled by the internal-only router. To expose an application or
service externally, you must create a new route with a specific label,
`route=external`.

To expose a new route for an existing service, apply the label `route=external`
and define a host name that contains the secondary, public router shard ID:

----
$ oc expose service <service-name> -l route=external --name=<custom-route-name> --hostname=<custom-hostname>.<shard-id>.<cluster-id>.openshiftapps.com
----

Alternatively, you can use a custom domain:

----
$ oc expose service <service-name> -l route=external --name=<custom-route-name> --hostname=<custom-domain>
----

== Expose TCP Services

to xref:../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#architecture-core-concepts-pods-and-services[pods and services]. A link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/#loadbalancer[LoadBalancer]
service creates an AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) for your {product-title} cluster, enabling direct TCP access to applications exposed by your LoadBalancer service.

[NOTE]
====
LoadBalancer services require an additional purchase. Contact your sales team if you are interested in using LoadBalancer services for your {product-title} cluster.
====

=== Check your LoadBalancer Quota

By purchasing LoadBalancer services, you are provided with a quota of LoadBalancers available for your {product-title} cluster.

----
$ oc describe clusterresourcequota service-loadbalancers
Name:       service-loadbalancers
Labels:     <none>
Annotations:    <none>
Resource        Used    Hard
--------        ----    ----
services.loadbalancers  0   4
----

=== Expose TCP Service

You can expose your applications over an external LoadBalancer service, enabling access over the public Internet.

----
$ oc expose dc httpd-example --type=LoadBalancer --name=lb-service
service/lb-service exposed
----

=== Create an Internal-Only TCP Service

You can alternatively expose your applications internally only, enabling access only through AWS VPC Peering or a VPN connection.

----
$ oc expose dc httpd-example --type=LoadBalancer --name=internal-lb --dry-run -o yaml | awk '1;/metadata:/{ print "  annotations:\n    service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-internal: 0.0.0.0/0" }' | oc create -f -
service/internal-lb exposed
----

=== Use your TCP Service

Once your LoadBalancer service is created, you can access your service by using the URL provided to you by {product-title}.
The `LoadBalancer Ingress` value is a URL unique to your service that remains static as long as the service is not deleted.
If you prefer to use a custom domain, you can create a CNAME DNS record for this URL.

----

console]. For help getting started with command line tools, see the
xref:../cli_reference/get_started_cli.adoc#cli-reference-get-started-cli[Get
Started with the CLI guide]. You can also visit the
xref:../getting_started/developers_console.adoc#getting-started-developers-console[Getting

Dedicated administrators should view the
xref:../admin_guide/index.adoc#admin-guide-index[Cluster Administration
Overview] for detailed information on available roles and permissions. This
section also includes important topics such as
xref:../admin_guide/quota.adoc#admin-guide-quota[managing

All {product-title} clusters are configured using the NetworkPolicy SDN.
Project admins can set NetworkPolicy objects on their projects.
Cluster admins can also set EgressNetworkPolicies.

endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-dedicated[]
If your cluster has been configured with the
xref:../admin_guide/managing_networking.adoc#admin-guide-networking-networkpolicy[NetworkPolicy
SDN], {product-title} administrators are able to create and modify NetworkPolicy
objects. NetworkPolicy, by default, allows traffic communication between
projects. Denying traffic between projects can be enabled by the creation of two
xref:../admin_guide/managing_networking.adoc#admin-guide-networking-networkpolicy-setting-default[NetworkPolicy
objects].

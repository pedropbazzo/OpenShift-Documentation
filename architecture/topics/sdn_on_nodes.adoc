== Design on Nodes

On a node, OpenShift SDN first registers the local host with the SDN
master in the aforementioned registry so that the master allocates a subnet to
the node.

Next, OpenShift SDN creates and configures three network devices:

* `br0`: the OVS bridge device that pod containers will be attached to.
OpenShift SDN also configures a set of non-subnet-specific flow rules on this
bridge.
* `tun0`: an OVS internal port (port 2 on `br0`). This gets assigned the
cluster subnet gateway address, and is used for external network
access. OpenShift SDN configures *netfilter* and routing rules to enable access
from the cluster subnet to the external network via NAT.
* `vxlan_sys_4789`: The OVS VXLAN device (port 1 on `br0`), which provides access to containers on remote nodes. Referred to as `vxlan0` in the OVS rules.

Each time a pod is started on the host, OpenShift SDN:

. assigns the pod a free IP address from the node's cluster subnet.
. attaches the host side of the pod's veth interface pair to the OVS bridge `br0`.
. adds OpenFlow rules to the OVS database to route traffic addressed to the new
pod to the correct OVS port.
. in the case of the *ovs-multitenant* plug-in, adds OpenFlow rules to tag
traffic coming from the pod with the pod's VNID, and to allow traffic into the
pod if the traffic's VNID matches the pod's VNID (or is the privileged VNID 0).
Non-matching traffic is filtered out by a generic rule.

OpenShift SDN nodes also watch for subnet updates from the SDN master. When a
new subnet is added, the node adds OpenFlow rules on `br0` so that packets with
a destination IP address in the remote subnet go to `vxlan0` (port 1 on `br0`) and
thus out onto the network. The *ovs-subnet* plug-in sends all packets across the
VXLAN with VNID 0, but the *ovs-multitenant* plug-in uses the appropriate VNID
for the source container.

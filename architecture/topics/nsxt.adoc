The VMware NSX-T (TM) Data Center provides a policy-based overlay network reproducing the complete set of Layer 2
through Layer 7 networking services (such as switching, routing, access control, fire-walling, and QoS) in software for
native {product-title} networking capabilities.

The NSX-T components can be installed and configured as part of the Ansible installation procedure, which integrates an {product-title} SDN
into a data-center-wide NSX-T virtualised network connecting bare metal, virtual machines, and {product-title} pods.
See the xref:../../install_config/configuring_nsxtsdn.adoc#install-config-configuring-nsxt-sdn[Installation] section for information on how to install and deploy {product-title} with VMware NSX-T.

The NSX-T Container Plug-In (NCP) integrates {product-title} into an NSX-T Manager, which is typically configured for the entire data center.

== Network Isolation

You can use the *ovs-multitenant* plug-in to achieve network isolation. When a
packet exits a pod assigned to a non-default project, the OVS bridge *br0* tags
that packet with the project's assigned VNID. If the packet is directed to
another IP address in the node's cluster subnet, the OVS bridge only allows the
packet to be delivered to the destination pod if the VNIDs match.

If a packet is received from another node via the VXLAN tunnel, the Tunnel ID
is used as the VNID, and the OVS bridge only allows the packet to be delivered
to a local pod if the tunnel ID matches the destination pod's VNID.

Packets destined for other cluster subnets are tagged with their VNID and
delivered to the VXLAN tunnel with a tunnel destination address of the node
owning the cluster subnet.

As described before, VNID 0 is privileged in that traffic with any VNID is
allowed to enter any pod assigned VNID 0, and traffic with VNID 0 is allowed to
enter any pod. Only the *default* {product-title} project is assigned VNID 0;
all other projects are assigned unique, isolation-enabled VNIDs. Cluster

[[differences-oc-kubectl-why-use]]
== Why Use oc Over kubectl?

Kubernetes' command line interface (CLI), `kubectl`, is used to run commands
against any Kubernetes cluster. Because {product-title} runs on top of a
Kubernetes cluster, a copy of `kubectl` is also included with `oc`,
{product-title}'s command line interface (CLI).

Although there are several similarities between these two clients, this guide's
aim is to clarify the main reasons and scenarios for using one over the other.

[[differences-oc-kubectl-using-oc]]
== Using oc

The `oc` binary offers the same capabilities as the `kubectl` binary, but it is
further extended to natively support {product-title} features, such as:

Full support for OpenShift resources::
Resources such as `DeploymentConfigs`, `BuildConfigs`, `Routes`, `ImageStreams`,
and `ImageStreamTags` are specific to OpenShift distributions, and not available
in standard Kubernetes.

Authentication::
The `oc` binary offers a built-in `login` command which allows authentication.
See xref:../dev_guide/authentication.adoc#dev-guide-authorization[developer authentication]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
and
xref:../install_config/configuring_authentication.adoc#install-config-configuring-authenticatio[configuring authentication]
endif::[]
for more information.

Additional commands::
For example, the additional command `new-app` makes it easier to get new
applications started using existing source code or pre-built images.

[[differences-oc-kubectl-using-kubectl]]
== Using kubectl

The `kubectl` binary is provided as a means to support existing workflows and
scripts for new {product-title} users coming from a standard Kubernetes
environment. Existing users of `kubectl` can continue to use the binary with no
changes to the API, but should consider upgrading to `oc` in order to gain the
added functionality mentioned in the previous section.

Because `oc` is built on top of `kubectl`, converting a `kubectl` binary to `oc`
is as simple as changing the binary's name from `kubectl` to `oc`.

See xref:../cli_reference/get_started_cli.adoc#cli-reference-get-started-cli[Get Started with the CLI] for installation and setup instructions.

= About Red Hat OpenShift Container Storage
Red Hat OpenShift Container Storage (RHOCS) is a provider of agnostic persistent storage for {product-title} either in-house or in hybrid clouds. As a Red Hat storage solution, RHOCS is completely integrated with {product-title} for deployment, management, and monitoring regardless if it is installed on {product-title} (converged) or with {product-title} (independent). OpenShift Container Storage is not limited to a single availability zone or node, which makes it likely to survive an outage. You can find complete instructions for using RHOCS in the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openshift_container_storage/3.11/html-single/deployment_guide/index[RHOCS3.11 Deployment Guide].

During testing, Red Hat has seen issues with NFS (on RHEL) when used as storage backend for Registry.
Based on that, we do not recommend NFS (on RHEL) as storage backend for Registry.

Other NFS implementations in the marketplace might not have the issues that Red Hat testing found.
Please contact the individual NFS implementation vendor for more information on any testing they may have performed.

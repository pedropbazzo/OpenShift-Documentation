Integrating {product-title} with Google Compute Engine (GCE) requires the
following components or services.

A GCP project::

A GCP project is the base level organizing entity that forms the basis for
creating, enabling, and using all GCP services. This includes managing APIs,
enabling billing, adding and removing collaborators, and managing permissions.

See link:https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/cloud-platform-resource-hierarchy#projects[the project resource section in the GCP documentation] for more information.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Project IDs are unique identifiers, and project IDs must be unique across
all of Google Cloud Engine. This means you cannot use `myproject` as a project
ID if someone else has created a project with that ID before.
====

Billing::

You cannot create new resources unless billing is attached to an account. The
new project can be linked to an existing project or new information can be
entered.

See link:https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/manage-billing-account[Create, Modify, or Close Your Billing Account in the GCP documentation] for more information.

Cloud identity and access management::

Deploying {product-title} requires the proper permissions. A user must be able
to create service accounts, cloud storage, instances, images, templates, Cloud
DNS entries, and deploy load balancers and health checks. Delete permissions are
also helpful in order to be able to redeploy the environment while testing.

You can create service accounts with specific permissions, then use them to
deploy infrastructure components instead of regular users. You can also create
roles to limit access to different users or service accounts.

GCP instances use service accounts to allow applications to call GCP APIs. For
example, {product-title} node hosts can call the GCP disk API to provide a
persistent volume to an application.

Access control to the various infrastructure, service resources, and
fine-grained roles are available using the IAM service. For more information, see link:https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/[the Access cloud overview section of the GCP documentation].

SSH keys::

GCP injects SSH public keys as authorized keys so you can log in using SSH in
the created instances. You can configure the SSH keys per instance or
per project.

You can use existing SSH keys. GCP metadata can help with storing the SSH keys
that are injected at boot time in the instances to allow SSH access.

See link:https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/storing-retrieving-metadata[the Metadata section of the GCP documentation] for more information. 

GCP regions and zones::

GCP has a global infrastructure that covers regions and availability
zones. While deploying {product-title} in GCP on different zones can help avoid
single-point-of-failures, there are some caveats regarding storage. 

GCP disks are created within a zone. Therefore, if a {product-title} node host
goes down in zone "A" and the pods move to zone "B", the persistent
storage cannot be attached to those pods because the disks are in a different
zone.

Deploying a single zone of multizone {product-title} environment is an important
decision to make before installing {product-title}. If deploying a multizone
environment, the recommended setup is to use three different zones in a single region.

See link:https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/zones[the GCP documentation on regions and zones] and link:https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/regional-clusters[the Kubernetes documentation on multiple zones] for more information.

External IP address::

So that GCP instances can communicate with the Internet, you must attach an
external IP address to the instance. Also, an external IP address is required to
communicate with instances deployed in GCP from outside the Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Network.

[WARNING]
====
https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/vpc#internet_access_reqs[Requiring an `External IP address` for internet access] is a limitation of
the provider. You can configure firewall rules to block
incoming external traffic in instances if not needed.
====

See link:https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/ip-addresses/[the GCP
documentation on external IP address] for more information.

Cloud DNS::

GCP cloud DNS is a DNS service used to publish domain names to the global
DNS using GCP DNS servers. 

The public cloud DNS zone requires a domain name that you purchased either
through Googleâ€™s "Domains" service or through a third-party provider. When you
create the zone, you must link:https://cloud.google.com/dns/update-name-servers#change_your_domain_registrars_name_servers_for_your_domain[add the name servers provided by Google to the
registrar].

See link:https://cloud.google.com/dns/overview[the GCP documentation on Cloud DNS] for more information.

[NOTE]
====
GCP VPC networks have an internal DNS service that automatically
resolves internal host names.

The internal fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for an instance follows the `[HOST_NAME].c.[PROJECT_ID].internal` format.

See link:https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/internal-dns[the GCP documentation on Internal DNS] for more information.
====

Load balancing::

The GCP load balancing service enables the distribution of traffic across multiple instances in the GCP cloud.

There are five types of Load Balancing:

* link:https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/internal/[Internal]
* link:https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/network[Network load balancing]
* link:https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/http[HTTP(S) load balancing]
* link:https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/tcp-ssl/[SSL Proxy load balancing]
* link:https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/tcp/[TCP Proxy load balancing]

[NOTE]
====
HTTPS and TCP proxy load balancing are the only options for using
HTTPS health checks for master nodes, which checks the status of
*_/healthz_*.

Because HTTPS load balancing requires a custom certificate, this implementation
uses TCP Proxy load balancing to simplify the process.
====

See link:https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing-and-autoscaling[the GCP documentation on Load balancing] for more information.

Instances sizes::

A successful {product-title} environment requires some minimum hardware
requirements:

.Instances sizes
|===
|Role |Size

|Master |`n1-standard-8`
|Node |`n1-standard-4`
|===

GCP allows you to create custom instance sizes to fit different requirements.
See
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/creating-instance-with-custom-machine-type[Creating
an Instance with a Custom Machine Type] for more information, or see
link:https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/machine-types[Machine types] and
xref:../install/prerequisites.adoc#hardware[{product-title} Minimum Hardware
Requirements] for more information about instance sizes.

Storage Options::

By default, each GCP instance has a small root persistent disk that contains the
operating system. When applications running on the instance require more
storage space, you can add additional storage options to the instance:

* Standard persistent disks
* SSD persistent disks
* Local SSDs
* Cloud storage buckets

For more information, see link:https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/[the GCP documentation on Storage options].

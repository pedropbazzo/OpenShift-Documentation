==== Creating OpenStack User Accounts, Projects, and Roles

Before installing {product-title}, the Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP)
environment requires a project, often referred to as a _tenant_,
that stores the OpenStack instances that are to install the {product-title}. This project
requires ownership by a user and the role of that user to be set to `\_member_`.

The following steps show how to accomplish the above.

As the OpenStack overcloud administrator,

. Create a project (tenant) that is to store the RHOSP instances
+
[subs=+quotes]
----
$ openstack project create *<project>*
----
+
. Create a RHOSP user that has ownership of the previously created project:
+
[subs=+quotes]
----
$ openstack user create --password *<password> <username>*
----
+
. Set the role of the user:
+
----
$ openstack role add --user <username> --project <project> _member_
----

The default quotas assigned to new RH OSP projects are not high enough for
{product-title} installations. Increase the quotas to at least 30 security
groups, 200 security group rules, and 200 ports. If kuryr SDN is enabled, and
particularly if namespace isolation is used, increase the quotas to at least
100 security groups, 500 security group rules, and 500 ports.
----
$ openstack quota set --secgroups 30 --secgroup-rules 200 --ports 200 *<project>*
----

If Kuryr-SDN is used, with the namespace isolation feature enabled, there is
an extra step to make once the project is created. It needs to be added to
octavia.conf configuration to ensure LoadBalancer security groups belong to
that project and can be updated to enforce services isolation across
namespaces.

. Get the project ID
+
----
$ openstack project show *<project>*
+-------------+----------------------------------+
| Field       | Value                            |
+-------------+----------------------------------+
| description |                                  |
| domain_id   | default                          |
| enabled     | True                             |
| id          | PROJECT_ID                       |
| is_domain   | False                            |
| name        | *<project>*                      |
| parent_id   | default                          |
| tags        | []                               |
+-------------+----------------------------------+
----
+
. Add the project ID to [filename]octavia.conf on the controllers and restart
octavia worker.
+
----
$ source stackrc  # undercloud credentials
$ openstack server list
+--------------------------------------+--------------+--------+-----------------------+----------------+------------+
│
| ID                                   | Name         | Status | Networks
| Image          | Flavor     |
│
+--------------------------------------+--------------+--------+-----------------------+----------------+------------+
│
| 6bef8e73-2ba5-4860-a0b1-3937f8ca7e01 | controller-0 | ACTIVE |
ctlplane=192.168.24.8 | overcloud-full | controller |
│
| dda3173a-ab26-47f8-a2dc-8473b4a67ab9 | compute-0    | ACTIVE |
ctlplane=192.168.24.6 | overcloud-full | compute    |
│
+--------------------------------------+--------------+--------+-----------------------+----------------+------------+

$ ssh heat-admin@192.168.24.8  # ssh into the controller(s)

controller-0$ vi /var/lib/config-data/puppet-generated/octavia/etc/octavia/octavia.conf
[controller_worker]
# List of project ids that are allowed to have Load balancer security groups
# belonging to them.
amp_secgroup_allowed_projects = PROJECT_ID

controller-0$ sudo docker restart octavia_worker
----


Once the above is complete, an OpenStack administrator can create an RC file
with all the required information to the user(s) implementing the {product-title}
environment.

An example RC file:

[subs=+quotes]
----
$ cat path/to/examplerc
# Clear any old environment that may conflict.
for key in $( set | awk '{FS="="}  /^OS_/ {print $1}' ); do unset $key ; done
export OS_PROJECT_DOMAIN_NAME=Default
export OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME=Default
export OS_PROJECT_NAME=*<project-name>*
export OS_USERNAME=*<username>*
export OS_PASSWORD=*<password>*
export OS_AUTH_URL=http://*<ip>*:5000//v3
export OS_CLOUDNAME=*<cloud-name>*
export OS_IDENTITY_API_VERSION=3

# Add OS_CLOUDNAME to PS1
if [ -z "${CLOUDPROMPT_ENABLED:-}" ]; then
	export PS1=${PS1:-""}
	export PS1=\${OS_CLOUDNAME:+"(\$OS_CLOUDNAME)"}\ $PS1
	export CLOUDPROMPT_ENABLED=1
fi

----


[NOTE]
====
Changing _OS_PROJECT_DOMAIN_NAME and _OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME from the Default
value is supported as long as both reference the same domain.
====


As the user(s) implementing the {product-title} environment, within the OpenStack director
node or workstation, ensure to `source` the credentials as follows:

----
$ source path/to/examplerc

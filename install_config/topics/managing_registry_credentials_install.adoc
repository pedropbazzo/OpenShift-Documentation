= Managing Registry Credentials for Installation and Upgrade

You can also manage registry credentials during installation or upgrade using the
Ansible installer.

This will set up the following:

* `imagestreamsecret` in your OpenShift namespace.
* Credentials on all nodes.

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
The Ansible installer will require credentials when you are using the default
value of `registry.redhat.io` for either `openshift_examples_registryurl` or `oreg_url`.
endif::[]


.Prerequisites

* User credentials
* Service account
* Service account token

.Procedure

To manage  manage registry credentials during installation or upgrade using the
Ansible installer:

* During installation or upgrade, specify the `oreg_auth_user` and `oreg_auth_password`
variables in your installer inventory.

[NOTE]
====
If you have created a token, set `oreg_auth_password` to the value of the token.
====

Clusters that require access to additional authenticated registries can configure
a list of registries by setting `openshift_additional_registry_credentials`.
Each registry requires a host and password value, you can specify a username by
setting user. By default the credentials specified are validated by attempting
to inspect the image `openshift3/ose-pod` on the specified registry.

To specify an alternate image, either:

* Set `test_image`.
* Disable credential validation by setting `test_login` to False.

If the registry is insecure, set `tls_verify` to False.

All credentials in this list will have an `imagestreamsecret` created
in the OpenShift namespace and credentials deployed to all nodes.

For example:

----
openshift_additional_registry_credentials=[{'host':'registry.example.com','user':'name','password':'pass1','test_login':'False'},{'host':'registry2.example.com','password':'token12345','tls_verify':'False','test_image':'mongodb/mongodb'}]

== Configuring Alertmanager
:data-uri:
:icons:
:experimental:
:prewrap!:

The Alertmanager manages incoming alerts, including silencing, inhibition, aggregation, and sending out notifications through methods such as email, PagerDuty, and HipChat.

The default configuration of the {product-title} Monitoring Alertmanager cluster is:

----
  global:
    resolve_timeout: 5m
  route:
    group_wait: 30s
    group_interval: 5m
    repeat_interval: 12h
    receiver: default
    routes:
    - match:
        alertname: DeadMansSwitch
      repeat_interval: 5m
      receiver: deadmansswitch
  receivers:
  - name: default
  - name: deadmansswitch
----

This configuration can be overwritten using the Ansible variable `openshift_cluster_monitoring_operator_alertmanager_config` from the `openshift_cluster_monitoring_operator` role.

The following example configures link:https://www.pagerduty.com/[PagerDuty] for notifications. See the PagerDuty documentation for link:https://www.pagerduty.com/docs/guides/prometheus-integration-guide/[Alertmanager] to learn how to retrieve the `service_key`.

----
openshift_cluster_monitoring_operator_alertmanager_config: |+
  global:
    resolve_timeout: 5m
  route:
    group_wait: 30s
    group_interval: 5m
    repeat_interval: 12h
    receiver: default
    routes:
    - match:
        alertname: DeadMansSwitch
      repeat_interval: 5m
      receiver: deadmansswitch
    - match:
        service: example-app
      routes:
      - match:
          severity: critical
        receiver: team-frontend-page
  receivers:
  - name: default
  - name: deadmansswitch
  - name: team-frontend-page
    pagerduty_configs:
    - service_key: "<key>"
----

The sub-route matches only on alerts that have a severity of `critical`, and sends them via the receiver called `team-frontend-page`. As the name indicates, someone should be paged for alerts that are critical. See https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/configuration/[Alertmanager configuration] for configuring alerting through different alert receivers.

[[dead-mans-switch]]
== Dead man's switch

{product-title} Monitoring ships with a "Dead man's switch" to ensure the availability of the monitoring infrastructure.

The "Dead man's switch" is a simple Prometheus alerting rule that always triggers. The Alertmanager continuously sends notifications for the dead man's switch to the notification provider that supports this functionality. This also ensures that communication between the Alertmanager and the notification provider is working.

This mechanism is supported by PagerDuty to issue alerts when the monitoring system itself is down. For more information, see xref:#dead-mans-switch-pagerduty[Dead man's switch PagerDuty] below.

== Grouping alerts

Once alerts are firing against the Alertmanager, it must be configured to know how to logically group them.

For this example a new route will be added to reflect alert routing of the "frontend" team.

First, add new routes. Multiple routes may be added beneath the original route, typically to define the receiver for the notification. The following example uses a matcher to ensure that only alerts coming from the service `example-app` are used.

  global:
    resolve_timeout: 5m
  route:
    group_wait: 30s
    group_interval: 5m
    repeat_interval: 12h
    receiver: default
    routes:
    - match:
        alertname: DeadMansSwitch
      repeat_interval: 5m
      receiver: deadmansswitch
    - match:
        service: example-app
      routes:
      - match:
          severity: critical
        receiver: team-frontend-page
  receivers:
  - name: default
  - name: deadmansswitch

The sub-route matches only on alerts that have a severity of `critical`, and sends them via the receiver called `team-frontend-page`. As the name indicates, someone should be paged for alerts that are critical.

[[dead-mans-switch-pagerduty]]
== Dead man's switch PagerDuty

https://www.pagerduty.com/[PagerDuty] supports this mechanism through an integration called https://deadmanssnitch.com/[Dead Man's Snitch]. Simply add a `PagerDuty` configuration to the default `deadmansswitch` receiver. Use the process described above to add this configuration.

Configure Dead Man's Snitch to page the operator if the Dead man's switch alert is silent for 15 minutes. With the default Alertmanager configuration, the Dead man's switch alert is repeated every five minutes. If Dead Man's Snitch triggers after 15 minutes, it indicates that the notification has been unsuccessful at least twice.

[[create-user-accounts]]
=== Creating User accounts

//Concept

If you are a Red Hat customer with entitlements to Red Hat products, you have
an account with applicable user credentials. These are the username and password
that you use to log in to the Red Hat Customer Portal.

If you do not have an account, you can acquire one for free by registering for
one of the following options:

* link:https://developers.redhat.com/[*Red Hat Developer Program*]. This account
gives you access to developer tools and programs.
* link:https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-enterprise-linux/evaluation[*30-day Trial Subscription*].
This account gives you a 30-day trial subscription with access to select Red Hat
software products.

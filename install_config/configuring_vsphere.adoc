You can configure {product-title} to use link:https://www.vmware.com/au/products/vsphere.html[VMware vSphere]
VMDKs as to back PersistentVolumes. This configuration can include
xref:../install_config/persistent_storage/persistent_storage_vsphere.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-persistent-storage-vsphere[using
VMware vSphere VMDKs as persistent storage] for application data.

The vSphere Cloud Provider allows using vSphere-managed storage in
{product-title} and supports every storage primitive that Kubernetes uses:

* PersistentVolume (PV)
* PersistentVolumesClaim (PVC)
* StorageClass

PersistentVolumes requested by stateful containerized applications can be
provisioned on VMware vSAN, VVOL, VMFS, or NFS datastores.

Kubernetes PVs are defined in Pod specifications. They can reference VMDK files
directly if you use Static Provisioning or PVCs when you use Dynamic
Provisioning, which is preferred.

The latest updates to the vSphere Cloud Provider are in
link:https://vmware.github.io/vsphere-storage-for-kubernetes/documentation/index.html[vSphere Storage for Kubernetes].

[[vsphere-backup]]

== Backup of persistent volumes

{product-title} provisions new volumes as *independent persistent disks* to
freely attach and detach the volume on any node in the cluster. As a
consequence,

To create a backup of PVs:

. Stop the application using the PV.
. Clone the persistent disk.
. Restart the application.
. Create a backup of the cloned disk.
. Delete the cloned disk.

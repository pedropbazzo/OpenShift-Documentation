This guide walks through an example of building a simple Memcached Operator
(`memcached-operator`) using the `operator-sdk` CLI tool and
`controller-runtime` library API. It also shows how to manage the new Operator's
lifecycle from installation through updating to a new version.

As an administrator of a Kubernetes-based cluster, you can accomplish this using
two centerpieces of the Operator Framework:

Operator SDK:: Assists developers in bootstrapping and building an Operator
based on their expertise without requiring knowledge of Kubernetes API
complexities.

Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM):: Helps Operator users install, update, and
generally manage the lifecycle of all Operators and their associated services
running across their clusters.

== Getting involved

This guide provides an effective demonstration of the value of the Operator
Framework for building and managing Operators, but this is much more left out in
the interest of brevity. The Operator Framework and its components are open
source, so visit each project individually and learn what else you can do:

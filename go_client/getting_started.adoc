== Getting Started

{product-title} includes a client library for creating applications
to interact with {product-title} and Kubernetes clusters. Using the
Go programming language (golang), you write programs to perform
actions (such as get, list, watch, create, update, or delete) on
{product-title} and Kubernetes resources (such as pods, services,
and replicationcontrollers).

Both the client library and API object definitions are versioned, with separate
branches corresponding to major versions of {product-title}. You need
to match the client library version you use to the version of {product-title}
with which you are interacting.

For client-go applications, you use a
link:https://github.com/openshift/client-go[client library] and
link:https://github.com/openshift/api[API object definitions] to create
applications that interact with the OpenShift REST API. The openshift/client-go
library is designed to be compatible with and complementary to the
kubernetes/client-go library. To get started, we recommend you follow these
general steps:

. Read the link:https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go/blob/master/README.md[client-go README]: This file explains the components of Kubernetes
client-go, as well as which client-go versions you should use with different
versions of Kubernetes. You can also see link:https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go/tree/master/examples/in-cluster-client-configuration[in-cluster]
and link:https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go/tree/master/examples/out-of-cluster-client-configuration[out-of-cluster]
examples of go client applications. Refer to
link:https://github.com/openshift/client-go[OpenShift Client in Go] for
specifics about OpenShift compatibility issues.

. Read the link:https://github.com/openshift/client-go/blob/master/INSTALL.md[client-go INSTALL]: This helps you set up your client-go environment by vendoring (downloading) the correct code and helps you understand the tools you need to create applications.  Dependency management in particular is addressed.

. Review
link:https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go/tree/master/examples[client-go examples]:
These include examples of cluster authentication and managing resources, as well
as more advanced concepts for interfacing with work queues and custom resource
definitions.

. Review link:https://github.com/openshift/client-go/tree/master/examples/build[client-go build operations]: This example demonstrates basic operations for using build resources. These include `List builds`, `Retrieve details of a build`, and `Trigger a build`.

. Review the link:https://github.com/openshift/client-go/[client-go source code]: Go through the client-go source code, which contains the client-side code to invoke most actions against a cluster. To use the source code in a sample go project, all you need to do is to vendor these artifacts and write the code. When using Glide make sure to use 0.13.

= Comparing {ProductName} and upstream Istio community installations
An installation of {ProductName} differs from upstream Istio community installations in multiple ways. The modifications to {ProductName} are sometimes necessary to resolve issues, provide additional features, or to handle differences when deploying on OpenShift.

The current release of {ProductName} differs from the current upstream Istio community release in the following ways:

== Automatic injection
The upstream Istio community installation automatically injects the sidecar to namespaces you have labeled.

{ProductName} does not automatically inject the sidecar to any namespaces, but requires you to specify the `sidecar.istio.io/inject` annotation as illustrated in the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/servicemesh-install/servicemesh-install.html#automatic-sidecar-injection[Automatic sidecar injection] section.

== Role Based Access Control features
Role Based Access Control (RBAC) provides a mechanism you can use to control access to a service. You can identify subjects by username or by specifying a set of properties and apply access controls accordingly.

The upstream Istio community installation includes options to perform exact header matches, match wildcards in headers, or check for a header containing a specific prefix or suffix.

.Upstream Istio community matching request headers example

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: "rbac.istio.io/v1alpha1"
kind: ServiceRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: httpbin-client-binding
  namespace: httpbin
spec:
  subjects:
  - user: "cluster.local/ns/istio-system/sa/istio-ingressgateway-service-account"
    properties:
      request.headers[<header>]: "value"
----

{ProductName} extends the ability to match request headers by using a regular expression. Specify a property key of `request.regex.headers` with a regular expression.

.{ProductName} matching request headers by using regular expressions

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: "rbac.istio.io/v1alpha1"
kind: ServiceRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: httpbin-client-binding
  namespace: httpbin
spec:
  subjects:
  - user: "cluster.local/ns/istio-system/sa/istio-ingressgateway-service-account"
    properties:
      request.regex.headers[<header>]: "<regular expression>"
----

== Automatic route creation
{ProductName} automatically manages OpenShift routes for Istio gateways. When an Istio gateway is created, updated, or deleted in the {ProductShortName}, a matching OpenShift route is created, updated, or deleted.

If the following gateway is created:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: gateway1
spec:
  selector:
    istio: ingressgateway
  servers:
  - port:
      number: 80
      name: http
      protocol: HTTP
    hosts:
    - www.bookinfo.com
    - bookinfo.example.com
----

The following OpenShift routes are automatically created:

----
$ oc -n istio-system get routes
NAME              HOST/PORT                                            PATH      SERVICES               PORT      TERMINATION   WILDCARD
gateway1-lvlfn    bookinfo.example.com                                           istio-ingressgateway   <all>                   None
gateway1-scqhv    www.bookinfo.com                                               istio-ingressgateway   <all>                   None
----

If this gateway is deleted, {ProductName} will delete the routes.

[NOTE]
====
Manually created routes are not managed by the {ProductShortName}.
====

=== Catch-all domains
{ProductName} does not support catch-all or wildcard domains. If {ProductShortName} finds a catch-all domain in the gateway definition, {ProductName} will create the route but https://docs.okd.io/latest/architecture/networking/routes.html#route-hostnames[relies on OpenShift to create a default hostname]. The route that {ProductShortName creates will *not* be a catch-all route and will have a hostname with a `<route-name>[-<namespace>].<suffix>` structure.

=== Subdomains
Subdomains are supported, but they are not enabled by default in OpenShift. {ProductName} will create the route with the subdomain, but it will only work after you enable subdomains in OpenShift. See the https://docs.okd.io/latest/install_config/router/default_haproxy_router.html#using-wildcard-routes[OpenShift documentation on Wildcard Routes] for more information.

=== TLS
OpenShift routes are configured to support TLS.

[NOTE]
====
All OpenShift routes created by {ProductName} are in the `istio-system` namespace.

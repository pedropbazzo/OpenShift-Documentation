= {ProductName} installation prerequisites

Before you can install {ProductName}, you must meet the following prerequisites:

* Possess an active {product-title} subscription on your Red Hat account. If you do not have a subscription, contact your sales representative for more information.
* Install {product-title} version 3.11, or higher. For more information about the system and environment requirements, see the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/3.11/html/installing_clusters/install-config-install-prerequisites#system-requirements[OpenShift Container Platform documentation].
* Install the version of the {product-title} command line utility (the `oc` client tool) that matches your {product-title} version and add it to your path. For example, if you have {product-title} 3.11 you must have the matching `oc` client version 3.11. For installation instructions, see the {product-title} https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/3.11/html-single/cli_reference/#installing-the-cli[Command Line Reference] document.

== Preparing the {product-title} installation

Before you can install the {ProductShortName} into an {product-title} installation, you must modify the master configuration and each of the schedulable nodes. These changes enable the features that are required in the {ProductShortName} and also ensure that Elasticsearch features function correctly.


[[updating-node-configuration]]
== Updating the node configuration

[NOTE]
====
Updating the node configuration is not necessary if you are running {product-title} 4.0.
====

To run the Elasticsearch application, you must make a change to the kernel configuration on each node. This change is handled through the `sysctl` service.

Make the following changes on each node within your {product-title} installation:

. Create a file named `/etc/sysctl.d/99-elasticsearch.conf` with the following contents:
+
----
vm.max_map_count = 262144
----

+
. Execute the following command:
+

----
$ sysctl vm.max_map_count=262144
----

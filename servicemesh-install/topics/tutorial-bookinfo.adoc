[[bookinfo-tutorial]]
= Bookinfo tutorial

The upstream Istio project has an example tutorial called https://istio.io/docs/examples/bookinfo[bookinfo], which is composed of four separate microservices used to demonstrate various Istio features.  The Bookinfo application displays information about a book, similar to a single catalog entry of an online book store. Displayed on the page is a description of the book, book details (ISBN, number of pages and other information), and book reviews.

The Bookinfo application consists of four separate microservices:

* The `productpage` microservice calls the `details` and `reviews` microservices to populate the page.
* The `details` microservice contains book information.
* The `reviews` microservice contains book reviews. It also calls the `ratings` microservice.
* The `ratings` microservice contains book ranking information that accompanies a book review.

There are three versions of the reviews microservice:

* Version v1 does not call the `ratings` service.
* Version v2 calls the `ratings` service and displays each rating as one to five black stars.
* Version v3 calls the `ratings` service and displays each rating as one to five red stars.


[[installing-bookinfo-application]]
== Installing the Bookinfo application

The following steps describe deploying and running the Bookinfo tutorial on OpenShift Container Platform with {ProductShortName} {ProductVersion}.

Prerequisites:

* {product-title} 3.11 or higher installed.
* {ProductName} {ProductVersion} installed.

[NOTE]
====
{ProductName} implements auto-injection differently than the upstream Istio project, therefore this procedure uses a version of the `bookinfo.yaml` file annotated to enable automatic injection of the Istio sidecar.
====

. Create a project for the Bookinfo application.
+

----
$ oc new-project myproject
----

+
. Update the Security Context Constraints (SCC) by adding the service account used by Bookinfo to the `anyuid` and `privileged` SCCs in the _"myproject"_ namespace:
+

----
$ oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid -z default -n myproject
$ oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z default -n myproject
----

+
. Deploy the Bookinfo application in the _"myproject"_ namespace by applying the `bookinfo.yaml` file:
+

----
$ oc apply -n myproject -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maistra/bookinfo/master/bookinfo.yaml
----

+
. Create the ingress gateway for Bookinfo by applying the `bookinfo-gateway.yaml` file:
+

----
  $ oc apply -n myproject -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maistra/bookinfo/master/bookinfo-gateway.yaml
----

. Set the value for the `GATEWAY_URL` parameter:
+

----
$ export GATEWAY_URL=$(oc get route -n istio-system istio-ingressgateway -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
----

[[verifying-bookinfo-installation]]
== Verifying the Bookinfo installation

To confirm that the application is successfully deployed, run this command:

----
$ curl -o /dev/null -s -w "%{http_code}\n" http://$GATEWAY_URL/productpage
----

Alternatively, you can open `http://$GATEWAY_URL/productpage` in your browser.

[[add-default-destination-rules]]
== Add default destination rules

 . If you did not enable mutual TLS:
+

----
$ oc apply -n myproject -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/istio/istio/release-1.1/samples/bookinfo/networking/destination-rule-all.yaml
----

. If you enabled mutual TLS:
+

----
oc apply -n myproject -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/istio/istio/release-1.1/samples/bookinfo/networking/destination-rule-all-mtls.yaml
----

+
. To list all available destination rules:
+

----
$ oc get destinationrules -o yaml
----

[[removing-bookinfo-application]]
== Removing the Bookinfo application

When you finish with the Bookinfo application, you can remove it by running the cleanup script.

[TIP]
====
Several of the other tutorials in this document also use the Bookinfo application.  Do not run the cleanup script if you plan to continue with the other tutorials.
====

. Download the cleanup script:
+

----
$ curl -o cleanup.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maistra/bookinfo/master/cleanup.sh && chmod +x ./cleanup.sh
----

. Delete the Bookinfo virtualservice, gateway, and terminate the pods by running the cleanup script:
+

----
$ ./cleanup.sh
namespace ? [default] myproject
----

. Confirm shutdown by running these commands:
+

----
$ oc get virtualservices -n myproject
No resources found.
$ oc get gateway -n myproject
No resources found.
$ oc get pods -n myproject
No resources found.

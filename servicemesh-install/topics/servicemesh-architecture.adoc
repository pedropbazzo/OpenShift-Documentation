= {ProductName} product architecture

{ProductName}  is logically split into a data plane and a control plane:

* The *data plane* is composed of a set of intelligent proxies deployed as sidecars. These proxies intercept and control all inbound and outbound network communication between microservices in the service mesh; sidecar proxies also communicate with Mixer, the general-purpose policy and telemetry hub.

* The *control plane* is responsible for managing and configuring proxies to route traffic, and configuring Mixers to enforce policies and collect telemetry.

The components that make up the data plane and the control plane are:

* *Envoy proxy* is the _data plane_ component that intercepts all inbound and outbound traffic for all services in the service mesh. Envoy is deployed as a sidecar to the relevant service in the same pod.
* *Mixer* is the _control plane_ component responsible for enforcing access control and usage policies (such as authorization, rate limits, quotas, authentication, request tracing) and collecting telemetry data from the Envoy proxy and other services.
* *Pilot* is the _control plane_ component responsible for configuring the proxies at runtime. Pilot provides service discovery for the Envoy sidecars, traffic management capabilities for intelligent routing (for example, A/B tests or canary deployments), and resiliency (timeouts, retries, and circuit breakers).
* *Citadel* is the _control plane_ component responsible for certificate issuance and rotation.  Citadel provides strong service-to-service and end-user authentication with built-in identity and credential management. You can use Citadel to upgrade unencrypted traffic in the service mesh. Using Citadel, operators can enforce policies based on service identity rather than on network controls.

= {ProductName} installation overview

The {ProductName} installation process creates two different projects (namespaces):

* istio-operator project (1 pod)
* istio-system project (17 pods)

You first create a Kubernetes _operator_. This operator defines and monitors a _custom resource_ that manages the deployment, updating, and deletion of the {ProductShortName} components.

Depending on how you define the custom resource file, you can install one or more of the following components when you install the {ProductShortName}:

* *Istio* - based on the  open source https://istio.io/[Istio] project, lets you connect, secure, control, and observe the microservices that make up your applications.
* *Jaeger* - based on the opensource https://www.jaegertracing.io/[Jaeger] project, lets you perform tracing to monitor and troubleshoot transactions in complex distributed systems.
* *Kiali* - based on the opensource https://www.kiali.io/[Kiali] project, Kiali provides observability for your service mesh. Using Kiali lets you view configurations, monitor traffic, and view and analyze traces in a single console.
* *Launcher* - based on the opensource  http://fabric8.io/[fabric8] community, this integrated development platform helps you build cloud native applications and microservices. {ProductName} includes several boosters that let you explore features of the {ProductShortName}.

During the installation the operator creates an Ansible job that runs an Ansible playbook that performs the following installation and configuration tasks automatically:

* Creates the `istio-system` namespace
* Creates the `openshift-ansible-istio-installer-job` which installs the following components:
** Istio components:
*** istio-citadel
*** istio-egressgateway
*** istio-galley
*** istio-ingressgateway
*** istio-pilot
*** istio-policy
*** istio-sidecar-injector
*** istio-telemetry
** Elasticsearch
** Grafana
** Jaeger components:
*** jaeger-agent
*** jaeger-collector
*** jaeger-query
** Kiali components (if configured in the custom resource definition):
*** Kiali
** Prometheus
** 3scale Components (if configured in the custom resource definition):
*** 3scale-istio-adapter
* Performs the following launcher configuration tasks (if configured in the custom resource definition):
** Creates a `devex` project and installs the Fabric8 launcher into that project.
** Adds the cluster admin role to the {product-title} user specified in the launcher parameters in the custom resource file.

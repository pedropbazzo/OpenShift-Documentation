[[threescale-adapter]]
The 3scale Istio Adapter allows you to label a service running within the {ProductName} and integrate that service with the 3scale API Management solution.

Prerequisites:

* {ProductName} 0.7.0+
* A working 3scale account (https://www.3scale.net/signup/[SaaS] or https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_3scale_api_management/2.4/html/infrastructure/onpremises-installation[On-Premises])
* https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/servicemesh-install/servicemesh-install.html#service-mesh-install_prerequisites[{ProductName} prerequisites]
* Ensure Mixer policy enforcement is enabled. https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/servicemesh-install/install-prerequisites.html#update-mixer-policy-enforcement[Update Mixer policy enforcement] provides instructions to check the current Mixer policy enforcement status and enable policy enforcement.

[NOTE]
====
To configure the 3scale Istio Adapter, refer to https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/servicemesh-install/servicemesh-install.html#install_chapter_3[Installing Service Mesh] for instructions on adding adapter parameters to the custom resource file.
====

= Integrate the adapter with {ProductName}
You can use these examples to configure requests to your services using the 3scale Istio Adapter.

[NOTE]
====
Pay particular attention to the `kind: handler` resource. You must update this with your 3scale credentials and the service ID of the API you want to manage.
====

Modify the handler configuration with your 3scale configuration.

== Generating custom resources
The adapter embeds a tool that allows generation of the `handler`, `instance`, and `rule` custom resources.

.Usage
|===
|Option |Description |Required | Default

|`-h, --help`
|Produces help output for available options
|No
|

|`-t, --token`
|3scale access token
|Yes
|

|`-u, --url`
|3scale Admin Portal URL
|Yes
|

|`-s, --service`
|3scale API/Service ID
|Yes
|

|`--uid`
|Unique ID for resource names that is from the 3scale Admin Portal URL and service if not set.
|No
|Generated from the 3scale Admin Portal URL hostname and service ID if not provided

|`--fixup`
|Attempt to automatically correct validation errors
|No
|False

|`--auth`
|3scale authentication pattern to specify (1=Api Key, 2=App Id/App Key)
|No
|Hybrid

|`-o, --output`

|No
|Standard output
|===

== Generating manifests from a deployed adapter
To generate manifests from a deployed adapter, run the following command replacing the following arguments with the 3scale Admin Portal URL, Service ID, and access token:

----
$ oc exec -n istio-system $(oc get po -n istio-system -o jsonpath='{.items[?(@.metadata.labels.app=="3scale-istio-adapter")].metadata.name}') \
-it -- ./3scale-config-gen \
--url="https://replace-me.3scale.net:443" --service="example-service-id" --token="access-token"
----

This will produce sample output to the terminal and a unique identifier (UID) that must be used for multiple service use cases. Edit these samples if required and create the objects using the `oc create` command.

https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/servicemesh-install/servicemesh-install.html#routing-service-traffic-through-the-adapter[Update the workload] with the required annotations:

----
export SVC_ID="replace-me"
export DEPLOYMENT="replace-me"
patch="$(oc get deployment "${DEPLOYMENT}" --template='{"spec":{"template":{"metadata":{"labels":{ {{ range $k,$v := .spec.template.metadata.labels }}"{{ $k }}":"{{ $v }}",{{ end }}"service-mesh.3scale.net":"true","service-mesh.3scale.net/uid":"'"${SVC_ID}"'"}}}}}' )"
oc patch deployment "${DEPLOYMENT}" --patch ''"${patch}"''
----

== Routing service traffic through the adapter
To drive traffic for your service through the 3scale adapter, you need to match the rule `destination.labels["service-mesh.3scale.net"] == "true"` that you previously created in the configuration, in the kind: `rule resource`.

If you need to support multiple services, an additional label is required. It should be unique per service, for example `service-mesh.3scale.net/uid` as a default. You can to modify sample templates as required.

You must add a label to the `PodTemplateSpec` on the Deployment of the target workload. For example, in a `productpage` service, whose Pod is managed by the `productpage-v1` deployment, add the above label under `spec.template.labels` in `productpage-v1`, to have the adapter authorize requests to this service.

. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click *Update Service*.

= Caching behavior
Responses from 3scale System API's are cached by default within the adapter. Entries will be purged from the cache when they become older than the `cacheTTLSeconds` value. Also by default, automatic refreshing of cached entries will be attempted seconds before they expire, based on the `cacheRefreshSeconds` value. You can disable automatic refreshing by setting this value higher than the `cacheTTLSeconds` value.

Caching can be disabled entirely by setting `cacheEntriesMax` to a non-positive value.

By using the refreshing process, cached values whose hosts become unreachable will be retried before eventually being purged when past their expiry.

= Authenticating requests
This Technology Preview release supports the following authentication methods:
* *Standard API Keys*: single randomized strings or hashes acting as an identifier and a secret token.
* *Application identifier and key pairs*: immutable identifier and mutable secret key strings.

== Applying authentication patterns
Modify the `instance` custom resource, as illustrated in the following authentication method examples, to configure authentication behavior. You can accept the authentication credentials from:
* Request headers
* Request parameters
* Both request headers and query parameters

=== API key authentication method
{ProductShortName} looks for the API key in query parameters and request headers as specified in the `user` option in the `subject` custom resource parameter. It checks the values in the order given in the custom resource file. You can restrict the search for the API key to either query parameters or request headers by omitting the unwanted option.

In this example {ProductShortName} looks for the API key in the `user_key` query parameter. If the API key is not in the query parameter, {ProductShortName} then checks the `x-user-key` header.

.API key authentication method example

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: "config.istio.io/v1alpha2"
kind: instance
metadata:
  name: threescale-authorization
  namespace: istio-system
spec:
  template: authorization
  params:
    subject:
      user: request.query_params["user_key"] | request.headers["x-user-key"] | ""
    action:
      path: request.url_path
      method: request.method | "get"
----

If you want the adapter to examine a different query parameter or request header, change the name as appropriate. For example, to check for the API key in a query parameter named “key”, change `request.query_params["user_key"]` to `request.query_params["key"]`.

=== Application ID and application key pair authentication method
{ProductShortName} looks for the application ID and application key in query parameters and request headers, as specified in the `properties` option in the `subject` custom resource parameter. The application key is optional. It checks the values in the order given in the custom resource file. You can restrict the search for the credentials to either query parameters or request headers by not including the unwanted option.

In this example, {ProductShortName} looks for the application ID and application key in the query parameters first, moving on to the request headers if needed.

.Application ID and application key pair authentication method example

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: "config.istio.io/v1alpha2"
kind: instance
metadata:
  name: threescale-authorization
  namespace: istio-system
spec:
  template: authorization
  params:
    subject:
        app_id: request.query_params["app_id"] | request.headers["x-app-id"] | ""
        app_key: request.query_params["app_key"] | request.headers["x-app-key"] | ""
    action:
      path: request.url_path
      method: request.method | "get"
----

If you want the adapter to examine a different query parameter or request header, change the name as appropriate. For example, to check for the application ID in a query parameter named “identification”, change `request.query_params["app_id"]` to `request.query_params["identification"]`.

=== Hybrid authentication method
You can choose to not enforce a particular authentication method and accept any valid credentials for either method. If both an API key and an application ID/application key pair are provided, {ProductShortName} uses the API key.

In this example, {ProductShortName} checks for an API key in the query parameters, then the request headers. If there is no API key, it then checks for an application ID and key in the query parameters, then the request headers.

        app_id: request.query_params["app_id"] | request.headers["x-app-id"] | ""
        app_key: request.query_params["app_key"] | request.headers["x-app-key"] | ""
    action:
      path: request.url_path
      method: request.method | "get"

= Adapter metrics
The adapter, by default reports various Prometheus metrics that are exposed on port `8080` at the `/metrics` endpoint. These metrics provide insight into how the interactions between the adapter and 3scale are performing. The service is labeled to be automatically discovered and scraped by Prometheus.

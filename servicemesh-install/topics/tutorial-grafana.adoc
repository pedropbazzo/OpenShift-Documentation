= Grafana tutorial

Grafana is an open source a tool for creating monitoring and metric analytics and dashboards. You use Grafana to query, visualize, alert on your metrics no matter where they are stored: Graphite, Elasticsearch, OpenTSDB, Prometheus, or InfluxDB. Istio includes monitoring via Prometheus and Grafana.

This tutorial uses {ProductShortName} and the `bookinfo` tutorial to demonstrate how to set up and use the Istio Dashboard to monitor mesh traffic. As part of this task, you install the Grafana Istio add-on and use the web-based interface to view service mesh traffic data.

Prerequisites:

* {product-title} 3.11 or higher installed.
* {ProductName} {ProductVersion} installed.
* `Bookinfo` demonstration application installed.

== Accessing the Grafana dashboard

. A route to access the Grafana dashboard already exists. Query for details of the route:
+

----
  $ export GRAFANA_URL=$(oc get route -n istio-system grafana -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
----

+
. Launch a browser and navigate to navigate to `http://${GRAFANA_URL}`.  You see Grafana's home screen, as shown in the following figure:
+

+
. From the menu in the upper-left corner, select *Istio Mesh Dashboard* to see Istio mesh metrics.
+

+
. Generate some traffic by accessing the Bookinfo application:
+

----
$ curl -o /dev/null http://$GATEWAY_URL/productpage
----

+
The dashboard reflects the traffic through the mesh, similar to the following figure:
+

+
. To see detailed metrics for a service, click on a service name in the *Service* column. The service dashboard resembles the following figure:
+
image::grafana-services.png[]
+
Note that *TCP Bandwidth* metrics are empty, because Bookinfo only uses http-based services. The dashboard also displays metrics for workloads that call the *Client Workloads* service and for workloads that process requests from the *Service Workloads*. You can switch to a different service or filter metrics by client and service workloads by using the menus at the top of the dashboard.
+
. To switch to the workloads dashboard, click *Istio Workload Dashboard* on the menu in the upper-left corner. You will see a screen resembling the following figure:
+
image::grafana-workloads.png[]
+
This dashboard shows workload metrics and metrics for client (inbound) and service (outbound) workloads. You can switch to a different workload; to filter metrics by inbound or outbound workloads, use the menus at the top of the dashboard.

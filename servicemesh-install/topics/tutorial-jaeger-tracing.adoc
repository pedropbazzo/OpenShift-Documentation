= Distributed tracing tutorial

Jaeger is an open source distributed tracing system. You use Jaeger  for monitoring and troubleshooting microservices-based distributed systems.  Using Jaeger you can perform a trace, which follows the path of a request through various microservices that make up an application.  Jaeger is installed by default as part of the Service Mesh.

This tutorial uses {ProductShortName} and the `bookinfo` tutorial to demonstrate how you can perform a trace using the Jaeger component of {ProductName}.

Prerequisites:

* {product-title} 3.11 or higher installed.
* {ProductName} {ProductVersion} installed.
* `Bookinfo` demonstration application installed.

== Generating traces and analyzing trace data

. After you have deployed the Bookinfo application, generate some activity by accessing http://$GATEWAY_URL/productpage and refreshing the page a few times.
.  A route to access the Jaeger dashboard already exists. Query for details of the route:
+

----
$ export JAEGER_URL=$(oc get route -n istio-system jaeger-query -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
----

+
. Launch a browser and navigate to `https://${JAEGER_URL}`.

. In the left pane of the Jaeger dashboard, from the Service menu, select "productpage" and click the *Find Traces* button at the bottom of the pane. A list of traces is displayed, as shown in the following image:

+
. Click one of the traces in the list to open a detailed view of that trace.  If you click on the top (most recent) trace, you see the details that correspond to the latest refresh of the ``/productpage`.

The trace in the previous figure consists of a few nested spans, each corresponding to a Bookinfo service call, all performed in response to a ``/productpage` request. Overall processing time was 2.62s, with the *details* service taking 3.56ms, the *reviews* service taking 2.6s, and the *ratings* service taking 5.32ms. Each of the calls to remote services is represented by a client-side and server-side span. For example, the *details* client-side span is labeled `productpage details.myproject.svc.cluster.local:9080`. The span nested underneath it, labeled `details details.myproject.svc.cluster.local:9080`, corresponds to the server-side processing of the request. The trace also shows calls to *istio-policy*, which reflect authorization checks made by Istio.

Red Hat Service Reliability Engineering (SRE) manages security updates to the
cluster. Any maintenance that is required to address an open security issue as
identified by the OpenShift Security team or the Red Hat Security team will be
communicated in the status portal. The customer will be notified of the security
updates to be applied and updates will be scheduled depending on the urgency and
priority of the fix. In the case of extremely critical errata, your cluster can
be patched without the usual advance warning associated with cluster
maintenance.

`rkhunter` (root kit hunter) scans are run daily on every node in the cluster to
check the root file system for infected files. Port scan attack detection (PSAD)
is installed on the cluster and passively watches iptable logs for suspicious
network traffic. Any anomalies detected by the scans are consolidated by the
centralized management and reporting platform and escalated to the  SREs on
duty.

Users are allowed to run security assessments and penetration tests for their
own applications. The cloud infrastructure provider's rules must be followed.

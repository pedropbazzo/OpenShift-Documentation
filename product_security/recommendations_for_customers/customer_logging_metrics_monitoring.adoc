[[dedicated-security-logging-access]]
== Logging

{product-title} administrators can view all customer application logs in the
cluster, but application developers can only view logs for projects they have
permission to view. Kibana can be accessed at:

----
https://logs.[cluster-name].openshift.com
----

Audit logs are maintained by Red Hat and are kept for internal use only.

[[security-monitoring-customer]]
== Monitoring

{product-title} clusters come with an integrated Prometheus/Grafana stack
for cluster monitoring. This is accessible to users in the *Dedicated Admins*
group via the cluster console and can also be used to view cluster-level status
and capacity/usage through a Grafana dashboard:

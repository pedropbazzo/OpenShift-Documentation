xref:../../admin_guide/quota.adoc#admin-guide-quota[Resource quotas] provide
constraints that limit aggregate resource consumption per project. This helps
prevent resource starvation.

When deploying your application, it is important to tune based on memory and CPU
consumption, allocating enough resources for the application to function
properly. Images provided by {product-title} behave properly within the confines
of the memory they are allocated. However, for your own custom images you must
pay attention to the specific resources required to ensure they are available.

Liveness and readiness probes can be used to detect when a pod is in a bad state
and should be taken out of or never added into rotation. Liveness and readiness
checks are implemented as either HTTP calls, container executions, or TCP socket
calls and can contain any custom logic to validate that an application component
is healthy. See
xref:../../dev_guide/application_health.adoc#dev-guide-application-health[Application
Health] for more information.

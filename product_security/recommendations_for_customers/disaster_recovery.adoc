Planning for disaster recovery is always a crucial component of a sound security
posture. While Red Hat provides backup of project related resources it is the
responsibility of the customer to back up application-specific data for example,
special export and import procedures for database systems. In many cases, you
can back up application data by using the `oc rsync` command, assuming `rsync`
is installed within the container image.

The release adds the Kiali observability console to {ProductName}. Kiali provides a number of graphs that you can use to view the topography and health of the microservices that make up your service mesh. You can view predefined dashboards that provide detailed request and response metrics (volume, duration, size, TCP traffic) per inbound and outbound traffic. You can also browse your service mesh by application, workloads, and services to view the health of each element.

= New features Technology Preview 1
{ProductName} provides a number of key capabilities uniformly across a network of services:

* *Traffic Management* - Control the flow of traffic and API calls between services, make calls more reliable, and make the network more robust in the face of adverse conditions.
* *Service Identity and Security* - Provide services in the mesh with a verifiable identity and provide the ability to protect service traffic as it flows over networks of varying degrees of trustworthiness.
* *Policy Enforcement* - Apply organizational policy to the interaction between services, ensure access policies are enforced and resources are fairly distributed among consumers. Policy changes are made by configuring the mesh, not by changing application code.
* *Telemetry* -  Gain understanding of the dependencies between services and the nature and flow of traffic between them, providing the ability to quickly identify issues.

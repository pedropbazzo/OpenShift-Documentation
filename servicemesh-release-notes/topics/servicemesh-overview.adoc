= {ProductName} overview

[IMPORTANT]
====
This release of {ProductName} is a Technology Preview release only.  Technology Preview releases are not supported with Red Hat production service-level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete, and Red Hat does NOT recommend using them for production. Using {ProductName} on a cluster renders the whole OpenShift cluster as a technology preview, that is, in an unsupported state. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.  For more information see link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/[Red Hat Technology Preview Features Support Scope].

{ProductName} is a platform that provides behavioral insight and operational control over the service mesh, providing a uniform way to connect, secure, and monitor microservice applications.

The term _service mesh_ describes the network of microservices that make up applications in a distributed microservice architecture and the interactions between those microservices. As a service mesh grows in size and complexity, it can become harder to understand and manage.

Based on the open source https://istio.io/[Istio] project, {ProductName}  adds a transparent layer on existing distributed applications without requiring any changes to the service code. You add {ProductName} support to services by deploying a special sidecar proxy throughout your environment that intercepts all network communication between microservices. You configure and manage the service mesh using the control plane features.

{ProductName} provides an easy way to create a network of deployed services that provides discovery, load balancing, service-to-service authentication, failure recovery, metrics, and monitoring. A service mesh also provides more complex operational functionality, including A/B testing, canary releases, rate limiting, access control, and end-to-end authentication.

Provide the following info for each issue if possible:
Consequence - What user action or situation would make this problem appear  (If you have the foo option enabled and did x)? What did the customer experience as a result of the issue? What was the symptom?
Cause - Why did this happen?
Fix - What did we change to fix the problem?
Result - How has the behavior changed as a result?  Try to avoid “It is fixed” or “The issue is resolved” or “The error no longer presents”.

https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-4[MAISTRA-4] - The uninstall does not remove all the files, and as a result, when you re-install the istio-operator installation fails because `customresourcedefinitions.apiextensions.k8s.io "installations.istio.openshift.com"` already exists.

https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-5[MAISTRA-5] - `openshift-ansible-istio-installer-job` pod tries to start but with errors.
Graph layout - The layout for the Kiali graph can render differently, depending on your application architecture and the data to display (number of graph nodes and their interactions).  Because it is difficult if not impossible to create a single layout that renders nicely for every situation, Kiali offers a choice of several different layouts.  To choose a different layout, you can choose a different *Layout Schema* from the *Graph Settings* menu.

https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-13[MAISTRA-13] - Installer should determine release version from installed components.  At present, the installer queries the yaml file, however if the yaml has been modified, the installer is not able to remove an older version.

https://github.com/Maistra/openshift-ansible/pull/19/[MAISTRA-21] -  The default in the installer of 512Mi was too low for tracing.  Increased default Elasticsearch memory from 512 MB to 1 GB.

https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-61[MAISTRA-61] After all applicable resources are deployed to OpenShift, Istio sidecars may lose information about their routes and can no longer communicate with services until the next update is received.

https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-79[MAISTRA-79] - Running the `istiooc cluster up` command results in the istio-operator namespace deploying a pod responsible for continually ensuring the Elasticsearch sysctl requirements are met. This loop runs constantly causing a significant load on the system running the cluster.

https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-157[MAISTRA-157] The conditional rate limiting feature does not restrict access as expected.

https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-196[MAISTRA-196] If you edit the installation to modify a parameter, for example to enable authentication, the new installation will fail due to the existence of the new 1.1 CRD configmaps.

The workaround is to issue the following commands:

----
$ oc delete configmap -n istio-system istio-crd-10
$ oc delete configmap -n istio-system istio-crd-11
----

https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-245[MAISTRA-245] The sidecar injector pod fails to start if you are running the upstream community version.

The workaround is to edit the `istio-sidecarinjector` deployment and remove `/tmp` from the `/tmp/health` resources.

[NOTE]
====
The issue in https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-245[MAISTRA-245] only occurs if you specify `community:true` in your custom resource file. This does *not* apply if you are using Maistra community images or {ProductName} images.

https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KIALI-1284[KIALI-1284] In Istio, a Workload can be any pod or group of pods, regardless where they originate from. They may come from Kubernetes Deployments, Replica Sets or even as a single "orphan" pod. In Kiali the current assumption is that a Workload comes from a Deployment. This should represent the vast majority of the cases.

https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KIALI-1570[KIALI-1570]
When a graph is loading in the Kiali console, a message that the graph is empty is displayed instead of a message that the graph is loading.

https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KIALI-1572[KIALI-1572]
If you see this ERROR message when you view the Kiali logs, you can ignore it:

----
Failed to determine console version from file [/opt/kiali/console/version.txt]. error=open /opt/kiali/console/version.txt: no such file or directory Kiali: Console version: unknown
----

https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KIALI-1609[KIALI-1609]
When dealing with very small values (for example, less than 0.0.1 rps) you might encounter some inconsistencies in the graph. We are working on making changes to have this function better when dealing with very small values.

https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KIALI-2261[KIALI-2261] In the Kiali graph, unused links (that is, edges with no traffic) are being labeled as having 100% of the request traffic, even though there is currently no request traffic. See also https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KIALI-2296[KIALI-2296].

https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KIALI-2403[KIALI-2403] The Istio version is no longer listed on the Kiali About page after moving to Istio 1.1.0-snapshot.6, because the latest Istio Pilot now listens on a different port. Istio Pilot listens on port 8080, and you can visit Pilot to determine the Istio version (http://istio-pilot:8080/version).

https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KIALI-2430[KIALI-2430] When you click on TCP Edge, and then click on HTTP Edge the graph crashes in Kiali.

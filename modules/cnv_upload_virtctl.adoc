[[upload-vmdisk-virtctl]]
= Uploading a local disk image to a new PVC

You can use `virtctl image-upload` to upload a virtual machine disk image from
a client machine to your {product-title} cluster. This creates a PVC that can be
associated with a virtual machine after the upload has completed.

.Prerequisites

* A virtual machine disk image, in RAW or QCOW2 format. It can be compressed
using *xz* or *gzip*.
* *kubevirt-virtctl* must be installed on the client machine.
* The client machine must be xref:../install_config/router/default_haproxy_router.html#overview[configured]
to trust the OpenShift router's certificate.

.Procedure

. Identify the following items:
* File location of the VM disk image you want to upload
* Name and size desired for the resulting PVC

. Remove the existing passthrough route:
+
----
$ oc delete route -n cdi cdi-uploadproxy-route
----

. Create a secured route using re-encryption termination:
+
----
$ oc get secret -n cdi cdi-upload-proxy-ca-key -o=jsonpath="{.data['tls\.crt']}" | base64 -d > ca.pem

$ oc create route reencrypt cdi-uploadproxy-route -n cdi --service=cdi-uploadproxy --dest-ca-cert=ca.pem
----

. Use the `virtctl image-upload` command to upload your VM image,
making sure to include your chosen parameters. For example:
+
----
$ virtctl image-upload --uploadproxy-url=https://$(oc get route cdi-uploadproxy-route -n cdi -o=jsonpath='{.status.ingress[0].host}') --pvc-name=upload-fedora-pvc --pvc-size=10Gi --image-path=/images/fedora28.qcow2
----
+
[CAUTION]
====
To allow insecure server connections when using HTTPS, use the `--insecure`
parameter. Be aware that when you use the `--insecure` flag, the authenticity of
the upload endpoint is *not* verified.
====

. To verify that the PVC was created, view all PVC objects:
+
----
$ oc get pvc
----

Next, you can create a virtual machine object to bind to the PVC.

[id='add-crio-{context}']

== Adding CRI-O nodes to an {product-title} cluster
{product-title} does not support the direct upgrading of nodes from using the docker
container engine to using CRI-O. To upgrade an existing {product-title} cluster to use
CRI-O, do the following:

 * Scale up a node that is configured to use the CRI-O container engine
 * Check that the CRI-O node performs as expected
 * Add more CRI-O nodes as needed
 * Scale down Docker nodes as the cluster stabilizes

To see what actions are taken when you create a node with the CRI-O container engine, refer to link:https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible/blob/0435f8b3611572b5379374b1b1055f33e78e86ad/roles/container_runtime/tasks/package_crio.yml[Upgrading to CRI-O with Ansible].

[NOTE]
====
If you are upgrading your entire {product-title} cluster to {product-title} 3.10 or later,
and a containerized version of CRI-O is running on a node, the CRI-O container
will be removed from that node and the CRI-O rpm will be installed. The CRI-O
service will be run as a systemd service from then on. See
link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1618425[BZ#1618425] for
details.

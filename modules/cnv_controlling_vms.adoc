= Controlling virtual machines

You can start, stop, or restart a virtual machine, depending on its current
state.

Use the *virtctl* client utility to change the state of the virtual
machine, open virtual console sessions with the virtual
machines, and expose virtual machine ports as services.

The *virtctl* syntax is: `virtctl <action> <vm_name> <options>`

You can only control objects in the project you are currently working
in, unless you specify the `-n <project_name>` option.

Examples:

----
$ virtctl start example-vm
----

----
$ virtctl restart example-vm
----

----
$ virtctl stop example-vm
----

`oc get vm` lists the virtual machines in the project. `oc get vmi`
lists running virtual machine instances.

= Adding VirtIO drivers container disk to a virtual machine

{ProductName} distributes VirtIO drivers for Microsoft Windows as a container disk, available from the Red Hat Container Catalog. To xref:cnv-installing-virtio-drivers-installing-windows[install] or xref:cnv-installing-virtio-drivers-existing-windows[add] these drivers to a Windows virtual machine, attach the `virtio-win` container disk to the virtual machine as a SATA CD drive. 

.Procedure

* Add the `cnv-tech-preview/virtio-win` container disk as a `cdrom` disk in the Windows virtual machine configuration file. The container disk will be downloaded from the registry if it is not already present in the cluster.

<1> {ProductName} boots virtual machines disks in the order defined in the `VirtualMachine` configuration file. You can either define other disks for the virtual machine before the `virtio-win` container disk, or use the optional `bootOrder` parameter to ensure the virtual machine boots from the correct disk. If you specify the `bootOrder` for a disk, it must be specified for all disks in the configuration.

After the virtual machine has been created and started, the VirtIO drivers can be installed from the attached SATA CD drive xref:cnv-installing-virtio-drivers-installing-windows[during Windows installation on the virtual machine], or xref:cnv-installing-virtio-drivers-existing-windows[added to an existing Windows installation].

After the drivers have been installed, you can xref:cnv-removing-virtio-disk-from-vm[remove the `virtio-win` container disk] from the virtual machine.

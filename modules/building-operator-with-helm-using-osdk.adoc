= Building an Operator with Helm charts using the Operator SDK

This procedure walks through an example of building a simple Nginx Operator
powered by a Helm chart using tools and libraries provided by the Operator SDK.

[TIP]
====
It is best practice to build a new Operator for each chart. This can allow for
more native-behaving Kubernetes APIs (e.g., `oc get Nginx`) and flexibility if
you ever want to write a fully-fledged Operator in Go, migrating away from a
Helm-based Operator.
====

.Prerequisites

- Operator SDK CLI installed on the development workstation
- Access to a Kubernetes-based cluster v1.11.3+ (for example {product-title} 4.0)
using an account with `cluster-admin` permissions
- link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/[`kubectl`] v1.11.3+
(can alternatively use `oc`)

.Procedure

. *Create a new project.*
+
To create a new Helm-based, namespace-scoped `nginx-operator` project, use the
`operator-sdk new` command:
+
----
$ operator-sdk new nginx-operator \
  --api-version=example.com/v1alpha1 --kind=Nginx --type=helm
$ cd nginx-operator
----
+
[TIP]
====
See
xref:operators-appendices.adoc#operator-project-scaffolding-layout_operator-appendices[Appendices]
to learn about the project directory structure created by the previous commands.
====
+
This creates the `nginx-operator` project specifically for watching the Nginx
resource with APIVersion `example.com/v1apha1` and Kind `Nginx`.
+
.Operator scope
+
A namespace-scoped Operator (the default) watches and manages resources in a
single namespace, whereas a cluster-scoped operator watches and manages
resources cluster-wide. Namespace-scoped operators are preferred because of
their flexibility. They enable decoupled upgrades, namespace isolation for
failures and monitoring, and differing API definitions.
+
However, there are use cases where a cluster-scoped operator may make sense. For
example, the `cert-manager` operator is often deployed with cluster-scoped
permissions and watches so that it can manage issuing certificates for an entire
cluster.
+
If you would like to create your `nginx-operator` project to be cluster-scoped,
use the following `operator-sdk new` command instead:
+
----
$ operator-sdk new nginx-operator \
    --cluster-scoped --api-version=example.com/v1alpha1 \
    --kind=Nginx --type=helm
----
+
Using the `--cluster-scoped` flag will scaffold the new Operator with the
following modifications:
+
--
* `deploy/operator.yaml`: Set `WATCH_NAMESPACE=""` instead of setting it to the
Pod's namespace.
* `deploy/role.yaml`: Use `ClusterRole` instead of `Role`.
* `deploy/role_binding.yaml`:
** Use `ClusterRoleBinding` instead of `RoleBinding`.
** Set the subject namespace to `REPLACE_NAMESPACE`. This must be changed to the
namespace in which the Operator is deployed.
--

. *Customize the Operator logic.*
+
For this example, the `nginx-operator` executes the following reconciliation
logic for each Nginx Custom Resource (CR):
+
--
* Create a Nginx Deployment if it does not exist.
* Create a Nginx Service if it does not exist.
* Create a Nginx Ingress if it is enabled and does not exist.
* Ensure that the Deployment, Service, and optional Ingress match the desired
configuration (e.g., replica count, image, service type) as specified by the
Nginx CR.
--
+
By default, the `nginx-operator` watches `Nginx` resource events as shown in the
`watches.yaml` file and executes Helm releases using the specified chart:
+
----
---
- version: v1alpha1
  group: example.com
  kind: Nginx
  chart: /opt/helm/helm-charts/nginx
----

.. *Review the Nginx Helm chart.*
+
When a Helm Operator project is created, the Operator SDK creates an example Helm chart that contains a set of templates for a simple Nginx release.
+
For this example, templates are available for Deployment, Service, and Ingress
resources, along with a `NOTES.txt` template, which Helm chart developers use to
convey helpful information about a release.
+
If you are not already familiar with Helm Charts, take a moment to review the
link:https://docs.helm.sh/developing_charts/[Helm Chart developer documentation].

.. *Understand the Nginx CR spec.*
+
Helm uses a concept called
link:https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#customizing-the-chart-before-installing[values]
to provide customizations to a Helm chart's defaults, which are defined in the
Helm chart's `values.yaml` file.
+
Override these defaults by setting the desired values in the CR spec. You can
use the number of replicas as an example:

... First, inspect the `helm-charts/nginx/values.yaml` file to find that the chart
has a value called `replicaCount` and it is set to `1` by default. To have 2
Nginx instances in your deployment, your CR spec must contain `replicaCount: 2`.
+
Update the `deploy/crds/example_v1alpha1_nginx_cr.yaml` file to look like the
following:
+
----
apiVersion: example.com/v1alpha1
kind: Nginx
metadata:
  name: example-nginx
spec:
  replicaCount: 2
----

... Similarly, the default service port is set to `80`. To instead use `8080`,
update the `deploy/crds/example_v1alpha1_nginx_cr.yaml` file again by adding the
service port override:
+
----
apiVersion: example.com/v1alpha1
kind: Nginx
metadata:
  name: example-nginx
spec:
  replicaCount: 2
  service:
    port: 8080
----
+
The Helm Operator applies the entire spec as if it was the contents of a values
file, just like the `helm install -f ./overrides.yaml` command works.

. *Deploy the CRD.*
+
Before running the Operator, Kubernetes needs to know about the new custom
resource definition (CRD) the operator will be watching. Deploy the following CRD:
+
----
$ kubectl create -f deploy/crds/example_v1alpha1_nginx_crd.yaml
----

. *Build and run the Operator.*
+
There are two ways to build and run the Operator:
+
--
* As a Pod inside a Kubernetes cluster.
* As a Go program outside the cluster using the `operator-sdk up` command.
--
+
Choose one of the following methods.

.. _Option 1:_ Run as a Pod inside a Kubernetes cluster. This is the preferred
method for production use.
+
Build the `nginx-operator` image and push it to a registry:
+
----
$ operator-sdk build quay.io/example/nginx-operator:v0.0.1
$ docker push quay.io/example/nginx-operator:v0.0.1
----
+
Kubernetes deployment manifests are generated in the `deploy/operator.yaml`
file. The deployment image in this file needs to be modified from the
placeholder `REPLACE_IMAGE` to the previous built image. To do this, run:
+
----
$ sed -i 's|REPLACE_IMAGE|quay.io/example/nginx-operator:v0.0.1|g' deploy/operator.yaml
----
+
If you created your Operator using the `--cluster-scoped=true` flag, update the
service account namespace in the generated `ClusterRoleBinding` to match where
you are deploying your Operator:
+
----
$ export OPERATOR_NAMESPACE=$(kubectl config view --minify -o jsonpath='{.contexts[0].context.namespace}')
$ sed -i "s|REPLACE_NAMESPACE|$OPERATOR_NAMESPACE|g" deploy/role_binding.yaml
----
+
[NOTE]
====
If you are performing these steps on OSX, use the following commands instead:

----
$ sed -i "" 's|REPLACE_IMAGE|quay.io/example/nginx-operator:v0.0.1|g' deploy/operator.yaml
$ sed -i "" "s|REPLACE_NAMESPACE|$OPERATOR_NAMESPACE|g" deploy/role_binding.yaml
----
====
+
Deploy the `nginx-operator`:
+
----
$ kubectl create -f deploy/service_account.yaml
$ kubectl create -f deploy/role.yaml
$ kubectl create -f deploy/role_binding.yaml
$ kubectl create -f deploy/operator.yaml
----
+
Verify that the `nginx-operator` is up and running:
+
----
$ kubectl get deployment
NAME                 DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
nginx-operator       1         1         1            1           1m
----

.. _Option 2:_ Run outside the cluster. This method is preferred during the
development cycle to speed up deployment and testing.
+
It is important that the chart path referenced in the `watches.yaml` file exists
on your machine. By default, the `watches.yaml` file is scaffolded to work with
an Operator image built with the `operator-sdk build` command. When developing
and testing your operator with the `operator-sdk up local` command, the SDK
looks in your local file system for this path.
+
It is recommend to create a symlink at this location to point to your Helm
chart's path:
+
----
$ sudo mkdir -p /opt/helm/helm-charts
$ sudo ln -s $PWD/helm-charts/nginx /opt/helm/helm-charts/nginx
----
+
To run the Operator locally with the default Kubernetes configuration file
present at `$HOME/.kube/config`:
+
----
$ operator-sdk up local
INFO[0000] Go Version: go1.10.3
INFO[0000] Go OS/Arch: linux/amd64
INFO[0000] operator-sdk Version: v0.3.0+git
----
+
To run the Operator locally with a provided Kubernetes configuration file:
+
----
$ operator-sdk up local --kubeconfig=<path_to_config>
INFO[0000] Go Version: go1.10.3
INFO[0000] Go OS/Arch: linux/amd64
INFO[0000] operator-sdk Version: v0.3.0+git
----

. *Deploy the Nginx custom resource.*
+
Apply the Nginx CR that you modified earlier:
+
----
$ kubectl apply -f deploy/crds/example_v1alpha1_nginx_cr.yaml
----
+
Ensure that the `nginx-operator` creates the Deployment for the CR:
+
----
$ kubectl get deployment
NAME                                           DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
example-nginx-b9phnoz9spckcrua7ihrbkrt1        2         2         2            2           1m
----
+
Check the Pods to confirm two replicas were created:
+
----
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                                                      READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
example-nginx-b9phnoz9spckcrua7ihrbkrt1-f8f9c875d-fjcr9   1/1       Running   0          1m
example-nginx-b9phnoz9spckcrua7ihrbkrt1-f8f9c875d-ljbzl   1/1       Running   0          1m
----
+
Check that the Service port is set to `8080`:
+
----
$ kubectl get service
NAME                                      TYPE        CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
example-nginx-b9phnoz9spckcrua7ihrbkrt1   ClusterIP   10.96.26.3   <none>        8080/TCP   1m
----

. *Update the `replicaCount` and remove the port.*
+
Change the `spec.replicaCount` field from `2` to `3`, remove the `spec.service`
field, and apply the change:
+
----
$ cat deploy/crds/example_v1alpha1_nginx_cr.yaml
apiVersion: "example.com/v1alpha1"
kind: "Nginx"
metadata:
  name: "example-nginx"
spec:
  replicaCount: 3

$ kubectl apply -f deploy/crds/example_v1alpha1_nginx_cr.yaml
----
+
Confirm that the Operator changes the Deployment size:
+
----
$ kubectl get deployment
NAME                                           DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
example-nginx-b9phnoz9spckcrua7ihrbkrt1        3         3         3            3           1m
----
+
Check that the Service port is set to the default `80`:
+
----
$ kubectl get service
NAME                                      TYPE        CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)  AGE
example-nginx-b9phnoz9spckcrua7ihrbkrt1   ClusterIP   10.96.26.3   <none>        80/TCP   1m
----

. *Clean up the resources:*
+
----
$ kubectl delete -f deploy/crds/example_v1alpha1_nginx_cr.yaml
$ kubectl delete -f deploy/operator.yaml
$ kubectl delete -f deploy/role_binding.yaml
$ kubectl delete -f deploy/role.yaml
$ kubectl delete -f deploy/service_account.yaml
$ kubectl delete -f deploy/crds/example_v1alpha1_nginx_cr.yaml

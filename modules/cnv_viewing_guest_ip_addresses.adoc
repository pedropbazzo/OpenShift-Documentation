= Viewing guest IP addresses

You can view the IP addresses that are assigned to your Linux virtual machines
by installing a QEMU guest agent on the virtual machine. When the guest agent is
running, you can view the virtual machine IP addresses for each interface by
checking the VMI status on the command line.

.Procedure

. Install the QEMU guest agent on the virtual machine:
+
----
$ yum install -y qemu-guest-agent
----

. Start the QEMU guest agent service:
+
----
$ systemctl start qemu-guest-agent
----

. View the IP address information for a VMI:
+
----
$ oc describe vmi <vmi_name>

machine, or by running `oc get vmi -o yaml`.

= Managing a Memcached Operator using the Operator Lifecycle Manager

The previous section has covered manually running an Operator. In the next
sections, we will explore using the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM), which is
what enables a more robust deployment model for Operators being run in
production environments.

The OLM helps you to install, update, and generally manage the lifecycle of all
of the Operators (and their associated services) on a Kubernetes cluster. It
runs as an Kubernetes extension and lets you use `kubectl` for all the lifecycle
management functions without any additional tools.

.Prerequisites

- OLM installed on a Kubernetes-based cluster (v1.8 or above to support the
`apps/v1beta2` API group), for example {product-title} 4.0
Preview OLM enabled
- Memcached Operator built

.Procedure

. *Generate an Operator manifest.*
+
An Operator manifest describes how to display, create, and manage the
application, in this case Memcached, as a whole. It is defined by a
`CustomServiceVersion` (CSV) object and is required for the OLM to function.
+
For the purpose of this guide, we will continue with this
link:https://github.com/operator-framework/getting-started/blob/master/memcachedoperator.0.0.1.csv.yaml[predefined manifest file]
for the next steps. You can alter the image field within this manifest to
reflect the image you built in previous steps, but it is unnecessary. In the
future, the Operator SDK CLI will generate an Operator manifest for you, a
feature that is planned for the next release of the Operator SDK.
+
[NOTE]
====
See
link:https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager/blob/master/Documentation/design/building-your-csv.md[Building a CSV for the Operator Framework]
for more information on manually defining a manifest file.

. *Deploy the Operator.*

.. Deploy an Operator by applying the Operatorâ€™s manifest to the desired namespace
in the cluster:
+
----
$ curl -Lo memcachedoperator.0.0.1.csv.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/operator-framework/getting-started/master/memcachedoperator.0.0.1.csv.yaml
$ kubectl apply -f memcachedoperator.0.0.1.csv.yaml
$ kubectl get ClusterServiceVersion memcachedoperator.v0.0.1 -o json | jq '.status'
----

.. After applying this manifest, nothing has happened yet, because the cluster does
not meet the requirements specified in our manifest. Create the RBAC rules and
`CustomResourceDefinition` for the Memcached type managed by the Operator:
+
----
$ kubectl apply -f deploy/rbac.yaml
$ kubectl apply -f deploy/crd.yaml
----
+
Because the OLM creates Operators in a particular namespace when a manifest is
applied, administrators can leverage the native Kubernetes RBAC permission model
to restrict which users are allowed to install Operators.

. *Create an application instance.*
+
The Memcached Operator is now running in the `memcached` namespace. Users
interact with Operators via instances of `CustomResources`; in this case, the
resource has the kind `Memcached`. Native Kubernetes RBAC also applies to
`CustomResources`, providing administrators control over who can interact with
each Operator.
+
Creating instances of Memcached in this namespace will now trigger the Memcached
Operator to instantiate pods running the memcached server that are managed by
the Operator. The more `CustomResources` you create, the more unique instances
of Memcached are managed by the Memcached Operator running in this namespace.

----

. *Update an application.*
+
Manually apply an update to the Operator by creating a new Operator manifest
with a `replaces` field that references the old Operator manifest. The OLM
ensures that all resources being managed by the old Operator have their
ownership moved to the new Operator without fear of any programs stopping
execution. It is up to the Operators themselves to execute any data migrations
required to upgrade resources to run under a new version of the Operator.
+
The following command demonstrates applying a new

using a new version of the Operator and shows that the pods remain executing:

$ kubectl apply -f memcachedoperator.0.0.2.csv.yaml
$ kubectl get pods

= Importing an existing virtual machine image with DataVolumes

DataVolume objects provide orchestration of import, clone, and upload operations
associated with an underlying PVC.  DataVolumes are integrated with KubeVirt and
they can prevent a virtual machine from being started before the PVC has been
prepared.

[CAUTION]
====
When you import a disk image into a PersistentVolumeClaim, the disk image is
expanded to use the full storage capacity that is requested in the PVC. To use
this space, the disk partitions and file system(s) in the virtual machine
might need to be expanded.

The resizing procedure varies based on the operating system installed on the VM.
Refer to the operating system documentation for details.
====

.Prerequisites

* The virtual machine disk can be RAW or QCOW2 format and can be compressed
using *xz* or *gz*.
* The disk image must be available at either an *HTTP* or *S3*
endpoint.

.Procedure

. Identify an *HTTP* or *S3* file server that hosts the virtual disk
image that you want to import. You need the complete URL in the correct format:
+
* *_http://www.example.com/path/to/data_*
* *_s3://bucketName/fileName_*
+
. If your data source requires authentication credentials, edit the
*_endpoint-secret.yaml_* file and apply it to the cluster:
+
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: <endpoint-secret>
  labels:
    app: containerized-data-importer
type: Opaque
data:
  accessKeyId: ""  # <optional: your key or user name, base64 encoded>
  secretKey:    "" # <optional: your secret or password, base64 encoded>
----
+
----
$ oc apply -f endpoint-secret.yaml
----

. Edit the VM configuration file, optionally including the
`secretRef` parameter. In our example, we used a Fedora image:
+
----
apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualMachine
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    kubevirt.io/vm: vm-fedora-datavolume
  name: vm-fedora-datavolume

          - disk:

            name: datavolumedisk1
        machine:
          type: ""
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: 64M
      terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 0
      volumes:
      - dataVolume:
          name: fedora-dv
        name: datavolumedisk1
status: {}
----
+
. Create the virtual machine:
+
----
$ oc create -f vm-<name>-datavolume.yaml
----
+
The virtual machine and a DataVolume will now be created. The CDI controller
creates an underlying PVC with the correct annotation and begins the import
process. When the import completes, the DataVolume status changes to
*Succeeded* and the virtual machine will be allowed to start.
+
DataVolume provisioning happens in the background, so there is no need to
monitor it. You can xref:cnv_controlling_vms.adoc#controlvm[start the VM] and it will not run until the import is complete.

.Optional verification steps
. Run `$ oc get pods` and look for the importer pod. This pod
downloads the image from the specified URL and stores it on the provisioned PV.

. Monitor the DataVolume status until it shows *Succeeded*.
+
----
$ oc describe dv <data-label> <1>
----
<1> The data label for the DataVolume specified in the VirtualMachine configuration file.

. To verify that provisioning is complete and that the VMI has started, try
accessing its serial console:
+
----
$ virtctl console <vm-fedora-datavolume>
----

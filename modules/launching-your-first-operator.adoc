= Launching your first Operator

This section walks through creating a new Couchbase cluster using the Couchbase
Operator.

.Prerequisites

- {product-title} 3.11 with Technology Preview OLM enabled
- Access to the cluster using an account with `cluster-admin` permissions
- Couchbase Operator loaded to the Operator catalog (loaded by default with
Technology Preview OLM)

.Procedure

. As a cluster administrator (a user with the `cluster-admin` role), create a new
project in the {product-title} web console for this procedure. This example uses
a project called *couchbase-test*.

. Installing an Operator within a project is done through a Subscription object,
which the cluster administrator can create and manage across the entire cluster.
To view the available Subscriptions, navigate to the *Cluster Console* from the
drop-down menu, then to the *Operators* -> *Catalog Sources* screen in the left
navigation.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you want to enable additional users to view, create, and manage Subscriptions
in a project, they must have the `admin` and `view` roles for that project, as
well as the `view` role for the `operator-lifecycle-manager` project. Cluster
administrators can add these roles using the following commands:

----
$ oc policy add-role-to-user admin <user> -n <target_project>
$ oc policy add-role-to-user view <user> -n <target_project>
$ oc policy add-role-to-user view <user> -n operator-lifecycle-manager
----

This experience will be simplified in future releases of the OLM.
====

. Subscribe the desired project to the Couchbase catalog source from either the
web console or CLI.
+
Choose one of the following methods:
+
--
- For the web console method, ensure you are viewing the desired project, then
click *Create Subscription* on an Operator from this screen to install it to the
project.

- For the CLI method, create a YAML file using the following definition:
+
.*_couchbase-subscription.yaml_* file
----
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  generateName: couchbase-enterprise-
  namespace: couchbase-test <1>
spec:
  source: certified-operators
  name: couchbase-enterprise
  startingCSV: couchbase-operator.v1.0.0
  channel: preview
----
<1> Ensure the `namespace` field in the `metadata` section is set to the desired
project.
+
Then, create the Subscription using the CLI:
+
----
$ oc create -f couchbase-subscription.yaml
----
--

. After the Subscription is created, the Operator then appears in the *Cluster Service Versions*
screen, which is the catalog users can use to launch the software provided by
the Operator. Click on the Couchbase Operator to view more details about this
Operator's features:
+
.Couchbase Operator overview

. Before creating the Couchbase cluster, create a secret with the following
definition using the web console or CLI that holds credentials for the super
user account. The Operator reads this upon start up and configures the database
with these details:
+
--
.Couchbase secret
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: couchbase-admin-creds
  namespace: couchbase-test <1>
type: Opaque
stringData:
  username: admin
  password: password
----
<1> Ensure the `namespace` field in the `metadata` section is set to the desired
project.
--
+
Choose one of the following methods:
+
--
- For the web console method, click *Workloads* -> *Secrets* from the left
navigation, then click *Create* and choose *Secret from YAML* to enter the
secret definition.

- For the CLI method, save the secret definition to a YAML file (for example, *_couchbase-secret.yaml_*) and use the CLI to create it in the desired project:
+
----
$ oc create -f couchbase-secret.yaml
----
--

. Create the new Couchbase cluster.
+
[NOTE]
====
All users with the `edit` role in a given project can create, manage, and delete
application instances (a Couchbase cluster, in this example) managed by
Operators that have already been installed in the project, in a self-service
manner, just like a cloud service. If you want to enable additional users with
this ability, cluster administrators can add the role using the following
command:

----
$ oc policy add-role-to-user edit <user> -n <target_project>
----
====

.. From the *Cluster Service Versions* section of the web console, click *Create
Couchbase Operator* from the Operator's *Overview* screen to begin creating a
new `CouchbaseCluster` object. This object is a new type that the Operator has
made available in the cluster. The object works similar to the built-in
`Deployment` or `ReplicaSet` objects, but contains logic specific to managing
Couchbase.
+
[TIP]
====
When clicking the *Create Couchbase Operator* button, you may receive a 404
error the first time. This is a known issue; as a workaround, refresh this page
to continue.

+
The web console contains a minimal starting template, but you can

for all of the features the Operator supports.

.. Ensure that you configure the name of the secret that contains the `admin`
credentials:
+
----
apiVersion: couchbase.com/v1
kind: CouchbaseCluster
metadata:
  name: cb-example
  namespace: couchbase-test
spec:
  authSecret: couchbase-admin-creds
  baseImage: registry.connect.redhat.com/couchbase/server
  [...]
----

.. When you have finalized your object definition, click *Create* in the web
console (or use the CLI) to create your object. This triggers the Operator to
start up the pods, services, and other components of the Couchbase cluster.

. Your project now contains a number of resources created and configured
automatically by the Operator:
+
.Couchbase cluster details
image::couchbase-cluster-details.png[]
+
Click the *Resources* tab to verify that a Kubernetes service has been
created that allows you to access the database from other pods in your project.
+
Using the `cb-example` service, you can connect to the database using the
credentials saved in the secret. Other application pods can mount and use this
secret and communicate with the service.

You now have a fault-tolerant installation of Couchbase that will react to
failures and rebalance data as pods become unhealthy or are migrated between
nodes in the cluster. Most importantly, cluster administrators or developers can
easily obtain this database cluster by supplying high-level configuration; it is
not required to have deep knowledge of the nuances of Couchbase clustering or
failover.

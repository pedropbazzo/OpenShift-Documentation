project and are useful for monitoring and troubleshooting resource
scheduling, creation, and deletion issues.

Events are also included in the resource description, which you can retrieve 
by using the {product-title} client.

----
$ oc describe <resource_type> <resource_name>
$ oc describe vm <fedora-vm>
$ oc describe vmi <fedora-vm>
$ oc describe pod virt-launcher-fedora-vm-<random>

Resource descriptions also include configuration, scheduling, and status
details.

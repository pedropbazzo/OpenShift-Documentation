= Configuring CRI-O

Because CRI-O is intended to be deployed, upgraded and managed by {product-title},
you should only change CRI-O configuration files through {product-title} or for the
purposes of testing or troubleshooting CRI-O. On a running {product-title} node, most
CRI-O configuration settings are kept in the `/etc/crio/crio.conf` file.

Settings in a `crio.conf` file define how storage, the listening socket,
runtime features, and networking are configured for CRI-O.
Here's an example of the default `crio.conf` file (look in the file itself
to see comments describing these settings):

```
[crio]
root = "/var/lib/containers/storage"
runroot = "/var/run/containers/storage"
storage_driver = "overlay"
storage_option = [
        "overlay.override_kernel_check=1",
   ]

[crio.api]
listen = "/var/run/crio/crio.sock"
stream_address = ""
stream_port = "10010"
file_locking = true

[crio.runtime]
runtime = "/usr/bin/runc"
runtime_untrusted_workload = ""
default_workload_trust = "trusted"
no_pivot = false
conmon = "/usr/libexec/crio/conmon"
conmon_env = [
        "PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin",
   ]
selinux = true
seccomp_profile = "/etc/crio/seccomp.json"
apparmor_profile = "crio-default"
cgroup_manager = "systemd"
hooks_dir_path = "/usr/share/containers/oci/hooks.d"
default_mounts = [
        "/usr/share/rhel/secrets:/run/secrets",
   ]
pids_limit = 1024
enable_shared_pid_namespace = false
log_size_max = 52428800

[crio.image]
default_transport = "docker://"
pause_image = "docker.io/openshift/origin-pod:v3.11"
pause_command = "/usr/bin/pod"
signature_policy = ""
image_volumes = "mkdir"
insecure_registries = [
""
]
registries = [
"docker.io"
]

[crio.network]
network_dir = "/etc/cni/net.d/"
plugin_dir = "/opt/cni/bin"
```

The following sections describe how different CRI-O
configurations might be used in the `crio.conf` file.

== Configuring CRI-O storage
OverlayFS2 is the recommended (and default) storage driver for {product-title},
whether you use CRI-O or Docker as your container engine. See link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.10/scaling_performance/optimizing_storage.html#choosing-a-graph-driver[Choosing a graph driver]
for details on available storage devices.

[NOTE]
====
Although devicemapper is a supported storage facility for CRI-O, the CRI-O
garbage collection feature does not yet
work with devicemapper and so is not recommended for production use. Also,
see link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1625394[BZ1625394] and
link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1623944[BZ1623944] for other
devicemapper issues that apply to how both CRI-O and `podman` use
container storage.
====

Things you should know about CRI-O storage include the facts that CRI-O storage:

* Holds images by storing the root filesystem of
each container, along with any layers that go with it.

* Incorporates the same storage layer that is used with the Docker service.

* Uses `container-storage-setup` to manage the container storage area.

* Uses configuration information from the `/etc/containers/storage.conf` and `/etc/crio/crio.conf` files.

* Stores data in `/var/lib/containers` by default. That directory is used by
both CRI-O and tools for running containers (such as `podman`).

[NOTE]
====
Although they use the same storage directory, the container engine and the container tools manage
their containers separately.
====

* Can store both Docker version 1 and version 2 schemas.

For information on using `container-storage-setup` to configure storage for
CRI-O, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux_atomic_host/7/html-single/managing_containers/#using_container_storage_setup[Using container-storage-setup].

== Configuring CRI-O networking
CRI-O supports networking facilities that are compatible with the
link:https://github.com/containernetworking[Container Network Interface] (CNI).
Supported networking features include
loopback, flannel, and openshift-sdn, which are implemented as network plugins.

By default, {product-title} uses openshift-sdn networking. The following settings in the
`crio.conf` file define where CNI network configuration files are stored (`/etc/cni/net.d/`) and
where CNI plugin binaries are stored (`/opt/cni/bin/`)

```
[crio.network]
network_dir = "/etc/cni/net.d/"
plugin_dir = "/opt/cni/bin/"
```

To understand the networking features needed by CRI-O in {product-title}, refer to both
link:https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/release-1.3/docs/design/networking.md[Kubernetes]
and
link:https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/docs/openshift_networking_requirements.md[{product-title}]
networking requirements.

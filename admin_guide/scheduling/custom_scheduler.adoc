== Deploying the Scheduler

The steps below are the general process for deploying a scheduler into your cluster.

[NOTE]
====
Information on how to create/deploy a scheduler is outside the scope of this document. For an example, see link:https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/pkg/scheduler[*_plugin/pkg/scheduler_*] in the Kubernetes source directory.

<1> The name of the scheduler to use. When no scheduler name is supplied, the pod is automatically scheduled using the default scheduler.

. Run the following command to create the pod:
+
----
$ oc create -f scheduler.yaml
----

. Run the following command to check that the pod was created with the custom scheduler:
+
----
$ oc get pod custom-scheduler -o yaml
----

. Run the following command to check the status of the pod:
+
----
$ oc get pod
----
+
The pod should not be running.

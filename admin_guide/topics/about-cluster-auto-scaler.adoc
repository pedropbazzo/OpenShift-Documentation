= About the {product-title} auto-scaler

The auto-scaler in {product-title} repeatedly checks to see how many
pods are pending node allocation. If pods are pending allocation and
the auto-scaler has not met its maximum capacity, then new nodes are
continuously provisioned to accommodate the current demand. When
demand drops and fewer nodes are required, the auto-scaler removes
unused nodes. After you install the auto-scaler, its behavior is automatic. You
only need to add the desired number of replicas to the deployment.

In {product-title} version {product-version}, you can deploy the
auto-scaler only on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The auto-scaler uses
some standard AWS objects to manage your cluster size, including Auto
Scaling groups and Launch Configurations.

The auto-scaler uses the following assets:

Auto Scaling groups:: An Auto Scaling group is a logical
representation of a set of machines. You configure an Auto Scaling group with a
minimum number of instances to run, the maximum number of instances
that can run, and your desired number of instances to run. An Auto Scaling group
starts by launching enough instances to meet your desired capacity.
You can configure an Auto Scaling group to start with zero instances.

Launch Configurations::
A Launch Configuration is a template that an Auto Scaling group uses to launch
instances. When you create a Launch Configuration, you specify information such as:
* The ID of the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) to use as the base image
* The instance type, such as *m4.large*
* A key pair
* One or more security groups
* The subnets to apply the Launch Configuration to

{product-title} primed images::
When the Auto Scaling group provisions a new instance, the image that it launches must have
{product-title} already prepared. The Auto Scaling group uses this image to both automatically
bootstrap the node and enroll it within the cluster without any manual
intervention.

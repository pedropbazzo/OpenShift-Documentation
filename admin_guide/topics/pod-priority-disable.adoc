= Disabling priority and preemption

You can disable the pod priority and preemption feature. 

After the feature is disabled, the existing pods keep their priority fields, but preemption is disabled, and priority fields are ignored. If the feature is disabled, you cannot set a priority class name in new pods.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Critical pods rely on scheduler preemption to be scheduled when a cluster is under resource pressure. For this reason, Red Hat recommends not disabling preemption.
DaemonSet pods are scheduled by the DaemonSet controller and not affected by disabling preemption.
====

To disable the preemption for the cluster:

. Modify the `master-config.yaml` to set the `disablePreemption` parameter in the `schedulerArgs` section to `false`.

disablePreemption=false 
----

. Restart the {product-title} master service and scheduler to apply the changes.

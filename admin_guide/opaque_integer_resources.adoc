== Overview
//tag::oir-intro[]
Opaque integer resources allow cluster operators to provide new node-level
resources that would be otherwise unknown to the system. Users can consume these
resources in pod specifications, similar to CPU and memory. The scheduler performs 
resource accounting so that no more than the available amount is
simultaneously allocated to pods.

[NOTE]
====
Opaque integer resources are Alpha currently, and only resource accounting is
implemented. There is no resource quota or limit range support for these
resources, and they have no impact on QoS.
====

Opaque integer resources are called _opaque_ because {product-title} 
does not know what the resource is, but will schedule a pod on a node 
only if enough of that resource is available. They are called _integer resources_ 
because they must be available, or _advertised_, in integer amounts. The API server
restricts quantities of these resources to whole numbers. Examples of
_valid_ quantities are `3`, `3000m`, and `3Ki`. 
//end::oir-intro[]

Opaque integer resources can be used to allocate:

* Last-level cache (LLC)
* Graphics processing unit (GPU) devices
* Field-programmable gate array (FPGA) devices
* Slots for sharing bandwidth to a parallel file system.

For example, if a node has 800 GiB of a special kind of disk storage, you could create a name for the special storage, 
such as `_opaque-int-resource-special-storage_`. You could advertise it in chunks of a certain size, 
such as 100 GiB. In that case, your node would advertise that it has eight resources of type `opaque-int-resource-special-storage`.

Opaque integer resource names must begin with the prefix `pod.alpha.kubernetes.io/opaque-int-resource-`. 

== Creating Opaque Integer Resources

There are two steps required to use opaque integer resources. First, the cluster
operator must name and advertise a per-node opaque resource on one or more nodes. Second,
application developer must request the opaque resource in pods.

To make opaque integer resources available:

. Allocate the resource and assign a name starting with `pod.alpha.kubernetes.io/opaque-int-resource-`

. Advertise a new opaque integer resource by submitting
a PATCH HTTP request to the API server that specifies the available
quantity in the `status.capacity` for a node in the cluster. 
+
For example, the following HTTP request advertises five `foo` resources on the
`openshift-node-1` node. 
+
[options="nowrap"]
----
PATCH /api/v1/nodes/openshift-node-1/status HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json-patch+json
Host: openshift-master:8080

[
  {
    "op": "add",
    "path": "/status/capacity/pod.alpha.kubernetes.io~1opaque-int-resource-foo",
    "value": "5"
  }
]
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The `~1` in the `path` is the encoding for the character `/`. 
The operation path value in the JSON-Patch is interpreted as a
JSON-Pointer. For more details, refer to
link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901#section-3[IETF RFC 6901, section 3].
====
+
After this operation, the node `status.capacity` includes a new resource. The
`status.allocatable` field is updated automatically with the new resource
asynchronously.
+
[NOTE]
====
Since the scheduler uses the node `status.allocatable` value when evaluating pod
fitness, there might be a short delay between patching the node capacity with a
new resource and the first pod that requests the resource to be scheduled on
that node.
====

The application developer can then consume the opaque resources by editing the pod config to
include the name of the opaque resource as a key in the `spec.containers[].resources.requests` field.

//tag::oir-step[]
For example: The following pod requests two CPUs and one `foo` (an opaque resource).

[source,yaml,options="nowrap"]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: myimage
    resources:
      requests:
        cpu: 2
        pod.alpha.kubernetes.io/opaque-int-resource-foo: 1
----

The pod will be scheduled only if all of the resource requests are satisfied
(including CPU, memory, and any opaque resources). The pod will remain in the
`PENDING` state while the resource request cannot be met by any node.

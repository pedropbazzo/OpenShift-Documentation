= Restoring a project

To restore a project, create the new project, then restore any exported files
by running `oc create -f pods.json`. However, restoring a project from scratch
requires a specific order because some objects depend on others. For
example, you must create the `configmaps` before you create any `pods`.

== Procedure

. If the project was exported as a single file, import it by running the
following commands:
+
----
$ oc new-project <projectname>
$ oc create -f project.yaml
$ oc create -f secret.yaml
$ oc create -f serviceaccount.yaml
$ oc create -f pvc.yaml
$ oc create -f rolebindings.yaml
----

[WARNING]
====
Some resources, such as pods and default service accounts, can fail to be created.

API Service Status

Module included in the following assemblies:

* day_two_guide/environment_health_checks.adoc
////

The OpenShift API service runs on all
master instances. To see the status of the service,
view the master-api pods in the *kube-system* project:

----
oc get pod -n kube-system -l openshift.io/component=api

NAME                             READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
master-api-myserver.com          1/1       Running   0          56d
----

The API service exposes a health check, which can be queried externally using the API host name:

----
oc get pod -n kube-system -o wide
NAME                                               READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE       IP            NODE
master-api-myserver.com                            1/1       Running   0          7h        10.240.0.16   myserver.com/healthz

Troubleshoot Dynatrace OneAgent installation

Module included in the following assemblies:

* day_two_guide/dynatrace_oneagent_installation.adoc

Find out how to solve problems that you may encounter when deploying OneAgent on an {product-title}.
The first step is to obtain the location for `ONEAGENT_INSTALLER_SCRIPT_URL`. This information is presented to you during Dynatrace OneAgent xref:dynatrace_oneagent_installation.adoc#day-two-guide-dynatrace-oneagent-installation[installation].

=== Deployment seems successful, however the dynatrace/oneagent image can't be pulled 

----
$ oc get pods
NAME                       READY   STATUS         RESTARTS   AGE
dynatrace-oneagent-abcde   0/1     ErrImagePull   0          3s
----

----
$ oc logs -f dynatrace-oneagent-abcde
Error from server (BadRequest): container "dynatrace-oneagent" in pod "dynatrace-oneagent-abcde" is waiting to start: image can't be pulled
----

This is typically the case if the `dynatrace` service account hasn't been allowed to pull images from the RHCC (please see the xref:dynatrace_oneagent_installation.adoc#day-two-guide-dynatrace-oneagent-installation[installation] steps).

=== Deployment seems successful, but the dynatrace-oneagent container doesn't produce meaningful logs

----
$ oc get pods
NAME                       READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
dynatrace-oneagent-abcde   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          3s
----

----
$ oc logs -f dynatrace-oneagent-abcde
Error from server (BadRequest): container "dynatrace-oneagent" in pod "dynatrace-oneagent-abcde" is waiting to start: ContainerCreating
----

This is typically the case if the container hasn't yet fully started. Simply wait a few more seconds.

=== Deployment seems successful, but the dynatrace-oneagent container isn't running

----
$ oc process -f dynatrace-oneagent.yml ONEAGENT_INSTALLER_SCRIPT_URL="[oneagent-installer-script-url]" | oc create -f -
daemonset "dynatrace-oneagent" created
----

Please note that quotes are needed to protect the special shell characters in the Dynatrace OneAgent installer URL.

----
$ oc get pods
No resources found.

This is typically the case if the `dynatrace` service account hasn't been configured to run privileged pods (please see the xref:dynatrace_oneagent_installation.adoc#day-two-guide-dynatrace-oneagent-installation[installation] steps):

This is typically caused by a timing issue that occurs when application containers are started before Dynatrace OneAgent is fully installed on the system. As a consequence, some parts of your application may be uninstrumented. To be on the safe side, Dynatrace OneAgent should be fully installed and configured before you start your application containers. If your application is already running, restart its containers to achieve the same outcome.

[NOTE]
====
If you plan to install Dynatrace OneAgent on more than 50 hosts, please consider serving the installer script via a dedicated server, such as Amazon S3. Otherwise, with more than 50 concurrent connections, Dynatrace Server may throttle requests.

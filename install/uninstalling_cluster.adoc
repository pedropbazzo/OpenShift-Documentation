You can uninstall {product-title} hosts in your cluster by running the
*_uninstall.yml_* playbook. This playbook deletes {product-title} content
installed by Ansible, including:

- Configuration
- Containers
- Default templates and image streams
- Images
- RPM packages

The playbook deletes content for any hosts defined in the inventory file
that you specify when running the playbook.

[[uninstalling]]
= Uninstalling a {product-title} cluster

To uninstall
{product-title} across all hosts in your cluster, change to the playbook directory and run the playbook using the
inventory file you used most recently:

----
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
# ansible-playbook [-i /path/to/file] \ <1>
    /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/adhoc/uninstall.yml
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
# ansible-playbook [-i /path/to/file] \ <1>
    ~/openshift-ansible/playbooks/adhoc/uninstall.yml
endif::[]
----
<1> If your inventory file is not in the *_/etc/ansible/hosts_* directory, 
specify `-i` and the path to the inventory file.

[[uninstalling-nodes]]
=== Uninstalling nodes

To uninstall node components from specific hosts using the
*_uninstall.yml_* playbook while leaving the remaining hosts and cluster alone:

[WARNING]
====
Use this method only when attempting to uninstall specific node hosts, not
specific masters or etcd hosts. Uninstalling master or etcd hosts requires
more configuration changes in the cluster.
====

. Follow the steps in
xref:../admin_guide/manage_nodes.adoc#deleting-nodes[Deleting Nodes] to
remove the node object from the cluster.

. Create a different inventory file that references only those hosts. For
example, to delete content from only one node:
+
----
[OSEv3:children]
nodes <1>

[OSEv3:vars]
ansible_ssh_user=root
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
openshift_deployment_type=openshift-enterprise
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
openshift_deployment_type=origin
endif::[]

[nodes]
node3.example.com openshift_node_group_name='node-config-infra' <2>
----
<1> Include only the sections that apply to the hosts to uninstall.
<2> Include only the hosts to uninstall.

. Change to the playbook directory and run the *_uninstall.yml_* playbook:
+
----
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
# ansible-playbook -i /path/to/new/file \ <1> 
    /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/adhoc/uninstall.yml
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
# ansible-playbook -i /path/to/new/file \ <1> 
    ~/openshift-ansible/playbooks/adhoc/uninstall.yml
endif::[]
----
<1> Specify the path to the new inventory file.

When the playbook completes, all {product-title} content is removed from
the specified hosts.
